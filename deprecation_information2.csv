Community Updates â€” Requests 2.25.1 documentation,the requests extra is officially deprecated and will be removed in requests v2.26.0.,updated included ca bundle with new mistrusts and automated process for the future,features and improvements,features and improvements,urls with schemes that begin with http but are not http or https no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.,"sessions and adapters are now picklable, i.e., can be used with the multiprocessing library","fixed regression from v2.12.1 for urls with schemes that begin with http . these urls have historically been processed as though they were http-schemed urls, and so have had parameters added. this was removed in v2.12.2 in an overzealous attempt to resolve problems with idna-encoding those urls. this change was reverted: the other fixes for idna-encoding have been judged to be sufficient to return to the behaviour requests had before v2.12.0.",pinning for chardet and idna now uses major version instead of minor. this hopefully reduces the need for releases everytime a dependency is updated.,fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use the vendored import location.,"fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the basic auth parameters. while support for this behaviour has been readded, the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.","the json parameter to post and friends will now only be used if neither data nor files are present, consistent with the documentation.",session cookies not saved when session.request is called with return_response=false,"response is now a context manager, so can be used directly in a with statement without first having to be wrapped by contextlib.closing.",updated support for internationalized domain names from idna2003 to idna2008. this updated support is required for several forms of idns and is mandatory for .de domains.,certifi support was removed,added request.url attribute for context and redirects,the behavior of sessionredirectmixin was slightly altered. resolve_redirects will now detect a redirect by calling get_redirect_target instead of directly querying response.is_redirect and response.headers. advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.,support for connect timeouts! timeout now accepts a tuple which is used to set individual connect and read timeouts.,anything that is a subclass of mapping is now treated like a dictionary by the data= keyword argument.,"fixed several issues with idna-encoding urls that are technically invalid but which are widely accepted. requests will now attempt to idna-encode a url if it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ascii characters, it will be passed through optimistically. this will allow users to opt-in to using idna2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid but still common hostnames.",the caseinsensitivedict used for http headers now behaves like a normal dictionary when references as string or viewed in the interpreter.,"cookies with , and _ allowed.",fixed a bug when using iter_content with decode_unicode=true for streamed bodies would raise attributeerror. this bug was introduced in 2.11.,fix error when requests is an install_requires dependency and python setup.py test is run. ,prevent hanging when using streaming uploads and digest auth when a 401 is received.,massive refactor and simplification,"if a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that request is redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, requests will now attempt to rewind the body object so it can be replayed.",fixed param handling with urls containing fragments.,sessions used by the functional api are always closed ,sessions are now closed in all cases when using the functional api rather than leaking and waiting for the garbage collector to clean them up.,"much improved handling of non-ascii location header values in redirects. fewer unicodedecodeerrors are encountered on python 2, and python 3 now correctly understands that latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.",changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.,"requests is an elegant and simple http library for python, built for human beings. you are currently looking at the documentation of the development release.",post redirects now break rfc to do what browsers do: follow up with a get.,pyopenssl tls implementation is now only used if python either doesn t have an ssl module or doesn t support sni. previously pyopenssl was unconditionally used if available. this applies even if pyopenssl is installed via the requests extra ,"switch back to using chardet, since it has merged with charade.",reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to reduce risk of header smuggling.,forced basic is default authentication type,resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original arguments to the adapter. ,fixed an issue where unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.,fixed an issue where urls with leading whitespace would raise invalidschema errors.,"when users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories requests now raises ioerror, rather than failing at the time of the https request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.",replace references of gittip with gratipay ,fixed an issue where some urls

packages and extensions,new features,new persistent sessions object and context manager,cve-2015-2296: fix handling of cookies on redirect. previously a cookie without a host value set would use the hostname for the redirected url exposing requests users to session fixation attacks and potentially cookie stealing. this was disclosed privately by matthew daley of .,"return connections to the pool when a chunked upload is successful, rather than leaking it.",changed the default user-agent string to avoid leaking data on linux: now contains only the requests version.,"added new method to httpadapter objects: httpadapter.proxy_headers. this should not be called directly, but improves the subclass interface.",cookies set by hooks are now correctly persisted on sessions.,changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip releases.,the timeout parameter now affects requests with both stream=true and stream=false equally.,"updated urllib3 to 1.10.4, resolving several bugs involving chunked transfer encoding and response framing.","requests now supports per-host proxies. this allows the proxies dictionary to have entries of the form { <scheme>://<hostname> : <proxy> }. host-specific proxies will be used in preference to the previously-supported scheme-specific ones, but the previous syntax will continue to work.",httplib.incompleteread exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding will now raise a requests chunkedencodingerror instead.,fixes incorrect parsing of proxy credentials that contain a literal or encoded # character.,added win_inet_pton as conditional dependency for the extra on windows with python 2.7.,"fixed an issue with json encoding detection, specifically detecting big-endian utf-32 with bom.",requests handling of unvendored dependencies is now more restrictive.,"if you d like to stay up to date on the community and development of requests, there are several options:",fixed cookies on sessions and on requests,add deprecation warnings to functions in requests.utils that will be removed in 3.0 ,"fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed would have the underlying connection closed but not returned to the connection pool, which could cause requests to hang in situations where the httpadapter had been configured to use a blocking connection pool.",fix regression where compressed data that was sent as chunked data was not properly decompressed. ,allow keyword arguments to be passed to json.loads via the response.json method,requests has officially stopped support for python 2.6.,added support for sha-256 and sha-512 digest auth algorithms.,added file attribute to post and put requests for multipart-encode file uploads.,restrict requests to http/1.1 and http/1.0 ,fixed bug with unintended authorization header stripping for redirects using default ports .,deprecated invalidmethodexception.,accept unicode methods in python 2.6 and 2.7.,allow usage of urllib3 s retry object with httpadapters ,"correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed qop directive that contains no token, by treating it the same as if no qop directive was provided at all.","requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather than stripping the credentials.",changed the proxy bypass implementation on windows: the proxy bypass check doesn t use forward and reverse dns requests anymore,requests has officially stopped support for python 3.4.,non-string objects can be passed in data values alongside files.,"requestexception is now a subclass of ioerror, not runtimeerror.","if no response.encoding is specified and chardet is available, response.text will guess an encoding.",update width of buttons and sidebar ,fix crash with custom method parameter to session.request ,"replace unicode errors on first pass, no need for second pass.","when using the preparedrequest flow, requests will now correctly handle a unicode-string method name on python 2. broken in 2.8.0.",dns resolution in proxy bypass no longer includes the username and password in the request. this also fixes the issue of dns queries failing on macos.,settings context manager and module,add forced basic authentication,fixed issue where non-utf8 reason phrases got severely mangled by falling back to decoding using iso 8859-1 instead.,requests will now use certifi if it is available.,copy pip s import machinery. when downstream redistributors remove requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let those same symbols work. example usage in requests documentation and 3rd-party libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3 will work without having to fallback to the system urllib3.,the iter_lines method on a response now accepts a delimiter with which to split the content ,"avoid data duplication when creating a request with str, bytes, or bytearray input to the files argument.",the change in how hooks are dispatched will likely cause a great deal of issues.,remove redundant generator for chunked transfer encoding,digest auth support is now thread safe.,cookies are now properly managed when 401 authentication responses are received.,cookies.get now supports default argument,"for file-like objects that are not sought to the very beginning, we now send the content length for the number of bytes we will actually read, rather than the total size of the file, allowing partial file uploads.",fragments are now properly maintained across redirects. ,handle unicodedecodeerrors when trying to deal with a unicode url that cannot be encoded in ascii. ,error messages for invalid headers now include the header name for easier debugging,attempt to quote parts of the url on redirect if unquoting and then quoting fails.

numpy.errstate context manager to silence these warnings in a more fine-grained manner, only around where these operations are actually used in the pandas code base.

Changelog â€” beets 1.4.9 documentation,mpd protocol commands consume and single are now supported along with updated semantics for repeat and previous and new fields for status. the bpd server now understands and ignores some additional commands. #3200 #800,"fuzzy search plugin: the fuzzy command was removed and replaced with a new query type. to perform fuzzy searches, use the ~ prefix with list or other commands. thanks to philippe mongeau.","when autotagging, and is considered equal to & .","the lyrics plugin, originally by peter brunner, is revamped and included with beets, making it easy to fetch song lyrics.","fixed some bugs with encoding paths on windows. also, : is now replaced with - in path names for readability.","the import logger has been improved for always-on use. first, it is now possible to specify a log file in .beetsconfig. also, logs are now appended rather than overwritten and contain timestamps.","the release label for albums and tracks is now fetched from !musicbrainz, written to files, and stored in the database.","the modify command is now better at parsing and formatting fields. you can assign to boolean fields like comp, for example, using either the words true or false or the numerals 1 and 0. any boolean-esque value is normalized to a real boolean. the update and write commands also got smarter at formatting and colorizing changes.",prefer releases that are closest to the tagged year. tolerate files tagged with release or original year.,album art in files with vorbis comments is now marked with the front cover type. thanks to jason lefley.,and there are smaller new features too:,fix a crash when an autotagging with an artist or album containing and or or .,you can now customize the character substituted for path separators in filenames via path_sep_replace. the default is an underscore. use this setting with caution.,alac files are now marked as alac instead of being conflated with aac audio. thanks to simon luijk.,"on python 3, the terminal_encoding setting is respected again for output and printing will no longer crash on systems configured with a limited encoding.","beets now communicates with musicbrainz via the new next generation schema service via python-musicbrainzngs. the bindings are included with this version of beets, but a future version will make them an external dependency.",bpd plugin: random and repeat modes are now supported .,"plugin architecture. add-on modules can now add new commands to the beets command-line interface. the bpd and dadd commands were removed from the beets core and turned into plugins; bpd is loaded by default. to load the non-default plugins, use the config options plugins and pluginpath . plugins are just python modules under the beetsplug namespace package containing subclasses of beets.plugins.beetsplugin. see the beetsplug directory for examples or plugins for instructions.","this version adds a healthy helping of new features and fixes a critical mpeg-4 related bug. there are more lyrics sources, there new plugins for managing permissions and integrating with plex, and the importer has a new --pretend flag that shows which music would be imported.",your library now keeps track of when music was added to it. the new added field is a timestamp reflecting when each item and album was imported and the new %time{} template function lets you format this timestamp for humans. thanks to lucas duailibe.,duplicates plugin: spurious reports are now avoided for tracks with missing values . thanks to pedro silva.,resizing image files with imagemagick now avoids problems on systems where there is a convert command that is not imagemagick s by using the magick executable when it is available. thanks to ababyduck. #2093 #3236,the default replace sanitation options now remove leading whitespace by default. thanks to brilnius.,also fix using id3v23 in conjunction with the scrub and embedart plugins. thanks to chris cogburn.,this release features two major additions to the autotagger s functionality: album art fetching and musicbrainz id tags. it also contains some important under-the-hood improvements: a new plugin architecture is introduced and the database schema is extended with explicit support for albums.,"while this feature is nifty when used directly with the usual command-line suspects, it s especially useful for plugin authors and for future beets features. stay tuned for great things built on this flexible attribute infrastructure.",bucket plugin: you can now customize the definition of alphanumeric ranges using regular expressions. and the heuristic for detecting years has been improved. thanks to sotho.,interactive prompts are sent to stdout instead of stderr.,"beets 1.0b13 consists of a plethora of small but important fixes and refinements. a lyrics plugin is now included with beets; new audio properties are catalogged; the list command has been made more powerful; the autotagger is more tolerant of different tagging styles; and importing with original file deletion now cleans up after itself more thoroughly. many, many bugs including several crashers were fixed. this release lays the foundation for more features to come in the next couple of releases.","the id3 apic tag now uses the latin-1 encoding when possible instead of a unicode encoding. this should increase compatibility with other software, especially with itunes and when using id3v2.3. thanks to lazka. #899 #2264 #2270","the directory hierarchy can now be customized based on release type. in particular, the path_format setting in .beetsconfig has been replaced with a new section, which allows you to specify different path formats for normal and compilation releases as well as for each album type . the default path formats have been changed to use $albumartist instead of $artist.","the importer now detects multi-disc albums and tags them together. using a heuristic based on the names of directories, certain structures are classified as multi-disc albums: for example, if a directory contains subdirectories labeled disc 1 and disc 2 , these subdirectories will be coalesced into a single album for tagging.","the importer can now move files. previously, beets could only copy files and delete the originals, which is inefficient if the source and destination are on the same filesystem. use the import_move configuration option and see configuration for more details. thanks to domen ko ar.",renamed plugins: the rdm plugin has been renamed to random and fuzzy_search has been renamed to fuzzy.,local album art is now automatically discovered and copied from the imported directories when available.,"the new chromaprint/acoustid plugin uses the acoustid open-source acoustic fingerprinting service. this replaces the old lastid plugin, which used last.fm fingerprinting and is now deprecated. fingerprinting with this library should be faster and more reliable.",web plugin: item and album counts are now exposed through the api for use with the tomahawk resolver. thanks to uwe l. korn.,fix a crash when numeric metadata fields contain just a minus or plus sign with no following numbers. thanks to eigengrau. #2741,bad files plugin: added a --verbose or -v option. results are now displayed only for corrupted files by default and for all the files when the verbose option is set. #1654 #2434,reorganized import config options: the various import_* options are now organized under an import: heading and their prefixes have been removed.,filenames are normalized with unicode normal form d on mac os x and nfc on all other platforms.,"this release adds two new standard plugins to beets: one for synchronizing last.fm listening data and one for integrating with linux desktops. and at long last, imports can now create symbolic links to music files instead of copying or moving them. we also gained the ability to search for album art on the itunes store and a new way to compute replaygain levels.","this is a short-term release that adds some great new stuff to beets. there s support for tracking and calculating musical keys, the replaygain plugin was expanded to work with more music formats via gstreamer, we can now import directly from compressed archives, and the lyrics plugin is more robust.","as part of the above, plugins can now extend the query syntax and new kinds of matching capabilities to beets. see extend the query syntax. thanks again to philippe mongeau.",the deprecated list_format_album and list_format_item configuration options have been removed .,sort missing and unmatched tracks by index and title and group them together for better readability.,the modify command can now accept query arguments that contain = signs. an argument is considered a query part when a : appears before any =s. thanks to mook.,"echonest_tempo: if the echo nest api limit is exceeded or a communication error occurs, the plugin now waits and tries again instead of crashing. thanks to zach denton.","pathlib is now an optional test dependency on python 3.4+, removing the need for a debian patch. #3275",beets should now be better at guessing the appropriate output encoding on windows. a bug was also fixed where beets would ignore the locale settings and use utf-8 by default. #1419,"with this release candidate, beets 1.0 is feature-complete. we ll be fixing bugs on the road to 1.0 but no new features will be added. concurrently, work begins today on features for version 1.1.","when importing with the delete option and importing files that are already at their destination, files could be deleted . this is fixed.",a new from_scratch configuration option makes the importer remove old metadata before applying new metadata. this new feature complements the zero and scrub plugins but is slightly different: beets clears out all the old tags it knows about and only keeps the new data it gets from the remote metadata source. thanks to tummychow. #934 #2755,fix a crash when importing with both of the group_albums and incremental options enabled. thanks to geigerzaehler.,"resuming is automatically disabled when the importer is in quiet mode. progress is still saved, however, and the -p flag can be used to force resuming.","the replaygain plugin, written by peter brunner, has been merged into the core beets distribution. use it to analyze audio and adjust playback levels in replaygain-aware music players.",languages controls the preferred languages when selecting an alias from musicbrainz. this feature requires python-musicbrainzngs 0.3 or later. thanks to sam doshi.,avoid some error cases in the update command and the embedart and mbsync plugins. invalid or missing files now cause error logs instead of crashing beets. thanks to lucas duailibe.,"artist sort names are now fetched from musicbrainz. there are two new data fields, artist_sort and albumartist_sort, that contain sortable artist names like beatles, the . these fields are also used to sort albums and items when using the list command. thanks to paul provost.","a new import_resume configuration option can be used to disable the importer s resuming feature or force it to resume without asking. this option may be either yes, no, or ask, with the obvious meanings. the -p and -p command-line flags override this setting and correspond to the yes and no settings.",possibly allow flexible attributes to be used with the %aunique template function. #1775,fix several uses of deprecated standard-library features on python 3.7. thanks to arcresu. #3197,"lyrics plugin: the genius backend is now more robust to communication errors. the backend has also been disabled by default, since the api it depends on is currently down. #1770","the default filename character substitutions were changed to be more conservative. the windows reserved characters are substituted by default even on unix platforms . to customize your character substitutions, see the replace config option.","when previewing changes during import, differences in track duration are now shown as 2:50 vs. 3:10 rather than separated with -> like track numbers. this should clarify that beets isn t doing anything to modify lengths.",the modify command now skips confirmation and prints a message if no changes are necessary. thanks to brilnius.,duplicates plugin: the move and copy destination arguments are now treated as directories. thanks to pedro silva.,"the top 3 distance penalties are now displayed on the release listing, and all album and track penalties are now displayed on the track changes list. this should make it clear exactly which metadata is contributing to a low similarity score.","play plugin: when relative_to is set, the plugin correctly emits relative paths even when querying for albums rather than tracks. thanks to j000. #2702","the centerpiece of this beets release is the graceful handling of similarly-named albums. it s now possible to import two albums with the same artist and title and to keep them from conflicting in the filesystem. many other awesome new features were contributed by the beets community, including regular expression queries, artist sort names, moving files on import. there are three new plugins: random song/album selection; musicbrainz collection integration; and a plugin for interoperability with other music library systems.","fix errors on windows for certain unicode characters that can t be represented in the mbcs encoding. this required a change to the way that paths are represented in the database on windows; if you find that beets paths are out of sync with your filesystem with this release, delete and recreate your database with beet import -awc /path/to/music.",the importer now ignores certain clutter files like .appledouble directories and ._* files. the list of ignored patterns is configurable via the ignore setting; see configuration.,new plugin: convert plugin transcodes music and embeds album art while copying to a separate directory. thanks to jakob schnitzer and andrew g. dunn.,"when a match isn t great but is either better than all the others or the only match, it is given a low recommendation.","accents and other unicode decorators on characters are now treated more fairly by the autotagger. for example, if you re missing the acute accent on the e in caf , that change won t be penalized. this introduces a new dependency on the unidecode python module.",fix a crash when unicode queries were used with import -l re-imports.,"this is mainly a bugfix release, but we also have a nifty new plugin for ipfs and a bunch of new configuration options.",there is no prompt default when matches are bad: low or none recommendations or when choosing a candidate other than the first.,use a nicer error message when input is requested but stdin is closed.,this version of beets focuses on increasing the accuracy of the autotagger. the main addition is an included plugin that uses acoustic fingerprinting to match based on the audio content . additional heuristics were also added to the metadata-based tagger as well that should make it more reliable. this release also greatly expands the capabilities of beets plugin api. a host of other little features and fixes are also rolled into this release.,"this release boasts a host of new little features, many of them contributed by beets amazing and prolific community. it adds support for opus files, transcoding to any format, and two new plugins: one that guesses metadata for blank files based on their filenames and one that moves featured artists into the title field.","a new field, composer_sort, is now supported and fetched from musicbrainz. thanks to dosoe. #2519 #2529","the new echonest plugin plugin can fetch a wide range of acoustic attributes from the echo nest, including the speechiness and liveness of each track. the new plugin supersedes an older version that only fetched the bpm field. thanks to pedro silva and peter schnebel.",the default output format for the beet list command is now configurable via the format_item and format_album config options. thanks to fabrice laporte.,"albums are now tagged with their original release date rather than the date of any reissue, remaster, special edition , or the like.","as a consequence of adding album art, the database was significantly refactored to keep track of some information at an album granularity. databases created with earlier versions of beets should work fine, but they won t have any albums in them they ll just be a bag of items. this means that commands like beet ls -a and beet rm -a won t match anything. to upgrade your database, you can use the included albumify plugin. running beets albumify with the plugin activated will group all your items into albums, making beets behave more or less as it did before.",filename substitutions are now configurable via the replace config value. you can choose which characters you think should be allowed in your directory and music file names. see configuration.,smart playlist plugin: playlists can now be generated from multiple queries . album-level queries are also now possible and automatic playlist regeneration can now be disabled. thanks to brilnius.,"the output of the update, remove, and modify commands now respects the format_album and format_item config options. thanks to mike kazantsev.",the new lastgenre plugin automatically assigns genres to imported albums and items based on last.fm tags and an internal whitelist. ,"in the replace configuration option, we now replace a leading hyphen with an underscore. #549 #2509","the preferred collection of settings specifies a sorted list of preferred countries and media types, or prioritizes releases closest to the original year for an album.","there are now multiple levels of output verbosity. on the command line, you can make beets somewhat verbose with -v or very verbose with -vv. for the importer especially, this makes the first verbose mode much more manageable, while still preserving an option for overwhelmingly verbose debug output. #1244","discogs plugin: subtracks are now detected and combined into a single track, two-sided mediums are treated as single discs, and tracks have media, medium_total and medium set correctly. #2222 #2228.","embedart plugin: in auto mode , the plugin now respects the write config option under import. if this is disabled, album art is no longer embedded on import in order to leave files untouched in effect, auto is implicitly disabled. #1427",importing without autotagging is now faster and doesn t print out a bunch of whitespace. it also lets you specify single files on the command line .,"after fifteen betas and two release candidates, beets has finally hit one-point-oh. congratulations to everybody involved. this version of beets will remain stable and receive only bug fixes from here on out. new development is ongoing in the betas of version 1.1.",date tags that use slashes instead of dashes as separators are now interpreted correctly. and wma files now map the comments field to the description tag . thanks to matthias kiefer. #1043,"when there s a parse error in a query , beets now stops with an error instead of silently ignoring the query component.","when an exception is raised while reading a file, the path of the file in question is now logged .","this release has one major backwards-incompatibility. because of the new way beets handles albums in the library, databases created with an old version of beets might have trouble with operations that deal with albums . to upgrade an old database, you can use the included albumify plugin .","smart playlist plugin: queries are now split using shell-like syntax instead of just whitespace, so you can now construct terms that contain spaces.",values for the replace option can now be empty .,album-level flexible attributes and plugin-provided attributes can now be used in path formats .,track titles in the importer ui s difference display are now either aligned vertically or broken across two lines for readability. thanks to tai lee.,"the modify command now allows removing flexible attributes. for example, beet modify artist:beatles oldies! deletes the oldies attribute from matching items. thanks to brilnius.","queries can now use or logic: if you use a comma to separate parts of a query, items and albums will match either side of the comma. for example, beet ls foo , bar will get all the items matching foo or matching bar. see combining keywords. #1423","detail enables a mode where all tracks are listed in the importer ui, as opposed to only changed tracks.","in addition to prefix-based field queries, plugins can now define named queries that are not associated with any specific field. for example, the new playlist plugin supports queries like playlist:name although there is no field named playlist. see extend the query syntax for details.",this release focuses on high-priority fixes and conspicuously missing features. highlights include support for two new audio formats and an option to log untaggable albums during import.,"this thrilling new release of beets focuses on making the tagger more usable in a variety of ways. first and foremost, it should now be much faster: the tagger now uses a multithreaded algorithm by default . second, the tagger output now uses a little bit of ansi terminal coloring to make changes stand out. this way, it should be faster to decide what to do with a proposed match: the more red you see, the worse the match is. finally, the tagger can be safely interrupted and restarted later at the same point. just enter b for abort at any prompt to stop the tagging process and save its progress. ","the config file and library databases are now given better names and locations on windows. namely, both files now reside in %appdata%; the config file is named beetsconfig.ini and the database is called beetslibrary.blb . for backwards compatibility, beets will check the old locations first.","when the importer finds duplicate albums, you can now merge all the tracks old and new together and try importing them as a single, combined album. thanks to udiboy1209. #112 #2725","lyrics plugin: lyrics should now be found for more songs. searching is now sensitive to featured artists and parenthesized title suffixes. when a song has multiple titles, lyrics from all the named songs are now concatenated. thanks to fabrice laporte and paul phillips.","fixed a crash when imported album art was also marked as clutter where the art would be deleted before it could be moved into place. this led to a image.jpg not found during copy error. now clutter is removed much later in the process, after the import_task_files hook.","this release is far too long in coming, but it s a good one. there is the usual torrent of new features and a ridiculously long line of fixes, but there are also some crucial maintenance changes. we officially support python 3.7 and 3.8, and some performance optimizations can make listing your library more than three times faster than in the previous version.","this release entirely revamps beets configuration system. the configuration file is now a yaml document and is located, along with other support files, in a common directory .","fetchart plugin: when loading art from the filesystem, we now prioritize covers with more keywords in them. this means that cover-front.jpg will now be taken before cover-back.jpg because it contains two keywords rather than one. thanks to fabrice laporte.","restore itunes store album art source, and remove the dependency on python-itunes, which had gone unmaintained and was not python-3-compatible. thanks to ocelma for creating python-itunes in the first place. thanks to nathdwek. #2371 #2551 #2718","this third beta of beets 1.1 brings a hodgepodge of little new features . there are new options for getting metadata in a particular language and seeing more detail during the import process. there s also a new plugin for synchronizing your metadata with musicbrainz. under the hood, plugins can now extend the query syntax.",added a --move or -m option to the importer so that the files can be moved to the library instead of being copied or added in place. #2252 #2429,"this release of beets fixes all the bugs, and you can be confident that you will never again find any bugs in beets, ever. it also adds support for plain old aiff files and adds three more plugins, including a nifty one that lets you measure a song s tempo by tapping out the beat on your keyboard. the importer deals more elegantly with duplicates and you can broaden your cover art search to the entire web with google image search.","the %asciify{} path formatting function and the asciify_paths setting properly substitute path separators generated by converting some unicode characters, such as and , into ascii.",and then query your music based on that field:,"the distance number, which quantifies how different an album s current and proposed metadata are, is now displayed as similarity instead. this should be less noisy and confusing; you ll now see 99.5% instead of 0.00489323.","a new plugin event, item_moved, is sent when files are moved on disk. thanks to dsedivec.",list_format_album and list_format_album have respectively been renamed format_album and format_item. the old names still work but each triggers a warning message. #1271,play plugin: fix $args getting passed verbatim to the play command if it was set in the configuration but -a or --args was omitted.,"fix a race in the importer that could cause files to be deleted before they were imported. this happened when importing one album, importing a duplicate album, and then asking for the first album to be replaced with the second. the situation could only arise when importing music from the library directory and when the two albums are imported close in time.","beta 7 s focus is on better support for various artists releases. these albums can be treated differently via the new config section and the autotagger is better at handling them. it also includes a number of oft-requested improvements to the beet command-line tool, including several new configuration options and the ability to clean up empty directory subtrees.",the importer can also now tag incomplete albums when you re missing a few tracks from a given release. two other new plugins are also included with this release: one for assigning genres and another for replaygain analysis.,fix an assertion failure while importing with moving enabled when the file was already at its destination.,"version 1.4 has alpha-level python 3 support. thanks to the heroic efforts of jrobeson, beets should run both under python 2.7, as before, and now under python 3.4 and above. the support is still new: it undoubtedly contains bugs, so it may replace all your music with limp bizkit but if you re brave and you have backups, please try installing on python 3. let us know how it goes.", fixed fields in album and item objects are now more strict about translating missing values into type-specific null-like values. this should help in cases where a string field is unexpectedly none sometimes instead of just showing up as an empty string. #2605,"parallel tagger. the autotagger has been reimplemented to use multiple threads. this means that it can concurrently read files from disk, talk to the user, communicate with musicbrainz, and write data back to disk. not only does this make the tagger much faster because independent work may be performed in parallel, but it makes the tagging process much more pleasant for large imports. the user can let albums queue up in the background while making a decision rather than waiting for beets between each question it asks. the parallel tagger is on by default but a sequential version is still available by setting the threaded config value to no .","importfeeds plugin: an option was added to use absolute, rather than relative, paths. thanks to lucas duailibe.",the importer now supports matching of pregap or htoa tracks when they are listed in musicbrainz. thanks to ruippeixotog. #1104 #1493,prompts in the importer interface are now colorized for easy reading. the default option is always highlighted.,fetchart plugin: complain when the enforce_ratio or min_width options are enabled but no local imaging backend is available to carry them out. #1460,filename extensions are now always lower-cased when copying and moving files.,"null values in the database can now be matched with the empty-string regular expression, ^$.","when writing id3 tags for replaygain normalization, tags are written with both upper-case and lower-case txxx frame descriptions. previous versions of beets used only the upper-case style, which seems to be more standard, but some players seem to only use lower-case names.","support for musicbrainz id tags. the autotagger now keeps track of the musicbrainz track, album, and artist ids it matched for each file. it also looks for album ids in new files it s importing and uses those to look up data in musicbrainz. furthermore, track ids are used as a component of the tagger s distance metric now. tangentially, this change required the database code to support a lightweight form of migrations so that new columns could be added to old databases this is a delicate feature, so it would be very wise to make a backup of your database before upgrading to this version.",a new import_task_created event lets you manipulate import tasks immediately after they are initialized. it s also possible to replace the originally created tasks by returning new ones using this event.,"replaygain tags on mpeg-4/aac files are now supported. and, even more astonishingly, replaygain values in mp3 and aac files are now compatible with itunes sound check. thanks to dave hayes.",album art fetching and plugin events are each now run in separate pipeline stages during imports. this should bring additional performance when using album art plugins like embedart or beets-lyrics.,"when choosing the as-is import album , every album either has an album artist set or is marked as a compilation . the choice is made based on the homogeneity of the tracks artists. this prevents compilations that are imported as-is from being scattered across many directories after they are imported.",importing with import_delete enabled now cleans up empty directories that contained deleting imported music files.,track changes are highlighted in yellow when they indicate a change in format to or from the style of per_disc_numbering. ,"duplicates plugin: duplicate resolution now uses an ordering to prioritize duplicates. by default, it prefers music with more complete metadata, but you can configure it to use any list of attributes.",resuming imports and beginning incremental imports should now be much faster when there is a lot of previously-imported music to skip.,"this release of beets brings two significant new features. first, beets now has first-class support for singleton tracks. previously, it was only really meant to manage whole albums, but many of us have lots of non-album tracks to keep track of alongside our collections of albums. so now beets makes it easy to tag, catalog, and manipulate your individual tracks. second, beets can now embed album art directly into file metadata rather than only storing it in a file on the side. check out the embedart plugin for that functionality.","missing plugin: missing is now treated as an integer, allowing the use of ranges in queries.","this update brings new plugins for fetching acoustic metrics and listening statistics, many more options for the duplicate detection plugin, and flexible options for fetching multiple genres.",the new bucket plugin provides a %bucket{} function for path formatting to generate folder names representing ranges of years or initial letter. thanks to fabrice laporte.,the default ignore settings now ignore all files beginning with a dot.,"this version of beets focuses on making it easier to manage your metadata after you ve imported it. a bumper crop of new commands has been added: a manual tag editor , a tool to pick up out-of-band deletions and modifications , and functionality for moving and copying files around . furthermore, the concept of re-importing is new: you can choose to re-run beets advanced autotagger on any files you already have in your library if you change your mind after you finish the initial import.","the importer has a new interactive option , command-line flag , and config option that lets you split apart albums that are mixed together in a single directory. thanks to geigerzaehler.",renamed config options: many plugins have a flag dictating whether their action runs at import time. this option had many names but is now consistently called auto.,"play plugin: a new raw configuration option lets the command work with players that expect music filenames as arguments, rather than in a playlist. thanks to nathdwek. #1578",you can now use checksumming to find duplicates instead of metadata via the checksum option.,"mpd protocol command idle is now supported, allowing the mpd version to be bumped to 0.14. #3205 #800","date fields are now written in the correct order , which eliminates an intermittent bug where the latter two fields would not get written to files. thanks to jdetrey. #1303 #1589","the duplicates plugin got a number of new features, thanks to pedro silva:","one note for upgraders and packagers: this version of beets has a new

metadata.",lyrics plugin: add musixmatch source and introduce a new sources config option that lets you choose exactly where to look for lyrics and in which order.,"the second beta of beets 1.1 uses the fancy new configuration infrastructure to add many, many new config options. the import process is more flexible; filenames can be customized in more detail; and more. this release also supports windows media files and itunes sound check volume normalization.","fix a terrible and long-standing bug where track orderings were never applied. this manifested when the tagger appeared to be applying a reasonable ordering to the tracks but, later, the database reflects a completely wrong association of track names to files. the order applied was always just alphabetical by filename, which is frequently but not always what you want.","when the importer ui shows a difference in track numbers or durations, they are now colorized based on the suffixes that differ. for example, when showing the difference between 2:01 and 2:09, only the last digit will be highlighted.","better support for singleton tracks. whereas beets previously only really supported full albums, now it can also keep track of individual, off-album songs. the singleton path format can be used to customize where these tracks are stored. to import singleton tracks, provide the -s switch to the import command or, while doing a normal full-album import, choose the as tracks option to add singletons to your library. to list only singleton or only album tracks, use the new singleton: query term: the query singleton:true matches only singleton tracks; singleton:false matches only album tracks. the lastid plugin has been extended to support matching individual items as well.","web plugin: a proper 404 error, instead of an internal exception, is returned when missing album art is requested. thanks to sumpfralle. #2011","the logging system in beets has been overhauled. plugins now each have their own logger, which helps by automatically adjusting the verbosity level in import mode and by prefixing the plugin s name. logging levels are dynamically set when a plugin is called, depending on how it is called . finally, logging calls can use modern {}-style string formatting lazily. see logging in the plugin api docs.","web plugin: the /item/ and /album/ api endpoints now produce full details about albums and items, not just lists of ids. thanks to geigerzaehler.",there are many fixes related to compatibility with our dependencies including addressing changes interfaces:,"fixed an issue where

zeroes in the database.,fixed a problem where duplicate albums or items imported at the same time would fail to be detected.,the importer now supports audio files contained in data tracks when they

.,"string comparisons in the autotagger have been augmented to act more intuitively. previously, if your album had the title something and it was officially called something , then beets would think this was a fairly significant change. it now checks for and appropriately reweights certain parts of each string. as another example, the title the great album is considered equal to great album, the

","this little update makes queries more powerful, sorts music more intelligently, and removes a performance bottleneck. there s an experimental new plugin for synchronizing metadata with music players.","when displaying differences, the colorization has been made more consistent and helpful: red for an actual difference, yellow to indicate that a distance penalty is being applied, and light gray for no penalty or disambiguation data.","fetchart plugin: two new configuration options were added: cover_names, the list of keywords used to identify preferred images, and cautious, which lets you avoid falling back to images that don t contain those keywords. thanks to fabrice laporte.","please note that this release contains one backwards-incompatible change: album art fetching, which was previously baked into the import workflow, is now encapsulated in a plugin . if you want to continue fetching cover art for your music, enable this plugin after upgrading to beets 1.0b15.",the %aunique template function for album disambiguation now takes a third argument that specifies which brackets to use around the disambiguator value. the argument can be any two characters that represent the left and right brackets. it defaults to and can also be blank to turn off bracketing. #2397 #2399,web plugin: the underlying api was expanded slightly to support tomahawk collections.

metadata contains newlines.,new metadata fields for artist credits: artist_credit and albumartist_credit can now contain release- and recording-specific variations of the artist s name. see available values.,fix an error when using the modify command to remove a flexible attribute. thanks to pierre rust.,the echonest plugin has been removed in this version because the api it used is shutting down. you might want to try the acousticbrainz plugin instead.,the summary shown to compare duplicate albums during import now displays the old and new filesizes. #1291,"there s a lot of new stuff in this release: new data sources for the autotagger, new plugins to look for problems in your library, tracking the date that you acquired new music, an awesome new syntax for doing queries over numeric fields, support for alac files, and major enhancements to the importer s ui and distance calculations. a special thanks goes out to all the contributors who helped make this release awesome.",an option to the beet import command for logging albums that are untaggable . use beet import -l logfile paths. the log format is very simple: it s just a status followed by the path to the album in question. the idea is that you can tag a large collection and automatically keep track of the albums that weren t found in musicbrainz so you can come back and look at them later.,"remove the beatport plugin. beatport has shut off public access to their api and denied our request for an account. we have not heard from the company since 2013, so we are assuming access will not be restored.","play plugin: fixed a typo in a configuration option. the option is now warning_threshold instead of warning_treshold, but we kept the old name around for compatibility. thanks to jesseweinstein. #1802

optional; any query containing a path separator is assumed to be a path query. running beet ls path/to/music will show all the music in your library under the specified directory. the queries reference again has more details.,fetchart plugin: you can now search for art on the itunes store. there s also a new sources config option that lets you choose exactly where to look for images and in which order.,"the colors used in the terminal interface are now configurable via the new config option colors, nested under the option ui. #1238","version 1.3.3 brings a bunch changes to how item and album fields work internally. along with laying the groundwork for some great things in the future, this brings a number of improvements to how you interact with beets. here s what s new with fields in particular:","according to the new max_rec configuration option, partial album matches are downgraded to a low recommendation by default.","ihate plugin: the plugin s configuration interface was overhauled. its configuration is now much simpler it uses beets queries instead of an ad-hoc per-field configuration. this is backwards-incompatible if you use this plugin, you will need to update your configuration. thanks to braindamage.",fix import with relative path arguments on windows.,ftintitle plugin: a new option lets you remove featured artists entirely instead of moving them to the title. thanks to sutjael.,lyrics plugin: only strip featured artists and parenthesized title suffixes if no lyrics for the original artist and title were found.,"a new link option in the import section creates symbolic links during import instead of moving or copying. thanks to rovanion luckey. #710, #114","the importer now gives you choices when duplicates are detected. previously, when beets found an existing album or item in your library matching the metadata on a newly-imported one, it would just skip the new music to avoid introducing duplicates into your library. now, you have three choices: skip the new music , keep both, or remove the old music. see the duplicates section in the autotagging guide for details.","the autotagger can now find matches for albums when you have extra tracks on your filesystem that aren t present in the musicbrainz catalog. previously, if you tried to match album with 15 audio files but the musicbrainz entry had only 14 tracks, beets would ignore this match. now, beets will show you matches even when they are too short and indicate which tracks from your disk are unmatched.","path queries are automatically triggered only if the path targeted by the query exists. previously, just having a slash somewhere in the query was enough, so beet ls ac/dc wouldn t work to refer to the artist.","a new --search-id importer option lets you manually specify ids for imported music. doing this skips the initial candidate search, which can be important for huge albums where this initial lookup is slow. also, the enter id prompt choice now accepts several ids, separated by spaces. #1808",the importer now provides the option to specify a musicbrainz id manually if the built-in searching isn t working for a particular album or track.,and countless little improvements and fixes:,mbsync plugin: track alignment now works with albums that have multiple copies of the same recording. thanks to rui gon alves.,"relatedly, the -l flag to the import command makes it take a query as its argument instead of a list of directories. the matched albums are then re-imported.",the musicbrainz collection plugin by jeffrey aylesworth was added to the core beets distribution.,importing a release with multiple release events now selects the event based on the order of your preferred countries rather than the order of release events in musicbrainz. #2816,"duplicates plugin: you can now merge duplicate track metadata , or duplicate album tracks .",there are also three more big features added to beets core:,fix a crash when beet is invoked without arguments. #1205 #1207,convert plugin: you can now configure the path formats for converted files separately from your main library. thanks again to lucas duailibe.,info plugin: fail gracefully when used erroneously with a directory.,suppress errors due to timeouts and bad responses from musicbrainz.," various artists releases are handled much more gracefully. the autotagger now sets the comp flag on albums whenever the album is identified as a various artists release by !musicbrainz. also, there is now a distinction between the album artist and the track artist , the latter of which is never various artists or other such bogus stand-in. ",the modify command s output now clearly shows when a file has been deleted.,"for developers, the short version of the story is that item and album objects provide uniform access across fixed, flexible, and computed attributes. you can write item.foo to access the foo field without worrying about where the data comes from.","to replace tracktotal as an album-level field, there is a new albumtotal computed attribute that provides the total number of tracks on the album. ","the media attribute is now a track-level field instead of an album-level one. this field stores the delivery mechanism for the music, so in its album-level incarnation, it could not represent heterogeneous releases for example, an album consisting of a cd and a dvd. now, tracks accurately indicate the media they appear on. thanks to heinz wiesinger.",the write command now only shows the changes to fields that will actually be written to a file.,terminal colors are now supported on windows via colorama .,there are a couple of changes for developers:,this final release of 1.1 brings a little polish to the betas that introduced the new configuration system. the album art and lyrics plugins also got a little love.,"plugins can now see updated import task state, such as when rejecting the initial candidates and finding new ones via a manual search. notably, this means that the importer prompt options that the edit plugin provides show up more reliably after doing a secondary import search. #2441 #2731","the big news in this release is a new interactive editor plugin. it s really nifty: you can now change your music s metadata by making changes in a visual text editor, which can sometimes be far more efficient than the built-in modify command. no more carefully retyping the same artist name with slight capitalization changes.",the old top-level colors configuration option has been removed .,and many improvements to existing plugins:,and many little fixes and improvements:,"this small update is part of our attempt to release new versions more often! there are a few important fixes, and we re clearing the deck for a change to beets dependencies in the next version.",a new initial_key field is available in the database and files tags. you can set the field manually using a command like beet modify initial_key=am.,the list_format_album and list_format_item configuration keys now affect every place where objects are printed and logged. #1269,"the load extension plugin allows loading of sqlite extensions, primarily for use with the icu sqlite extension for internationalization. #3160 #3226",for plugin developers: added an optparse callback utility function for performing actions based on arguments. thanks to pedro silva.,"this release introduces one new plugin to fetch audio information from the acousticbrainz project and another plugin to make it easier to submit your handcrafted metadata back to musicbrainz. the importer also gained two oft-requested features: a way to skip the initial search process by specifying an id ahead of time, and a way to manually provide metadata in the middle of the import process .",chromaprint/acoustid plugin: fix occasional crash at end of fingerprint submission and give more context to failed fingerprint generation errors.,"the calculation of the similarity score for autotagger matches was also improved, again thanks to tai lee. these changes, in general, help deal with the new metadata sources and help disambiguate between similar releases in the same musicbrainz release group:",the modify command avoids writing files and committing to the database when nothing has changed. thanks once more to brilnius.,this is a tiny bug-fix release. it copes with a dependency upgrade that broke beets. there are just two fixes:,metasync plugin: added a new backend to fetch metadata from itunes. this plugin is still in an experimental phase. #1450,lastgenre plugin: fixed a problem where path formats containing $genre would use the old genre instead of the newly discovered one.,"this version introduces one change to the default behavior that you should be aware of. previously, when importing new albums matched in musicbrainz, the date fields would be set to the release date of the original version of the album, as opposed to the specific date of the release selected. now, these fields reflect the specific release and original_year, etc., reflect the earlier release date. if you want the old behavior, just set original_date to true in your config file.","the case sensitivity of path queries is more useful now: rather than just guessing based on the platform, we now check the case sensitivity of your filesystem. #1586",the replace configuration option can now remove characters entirely if the special string <strip> is specified as the replacement.,lyrics plugin: the musixmatch backend now detects and warns when the server has blocked the client. thanks to anarcat. #2634 #2632,lyrics plugin: lyrics searches should now turn up more results due to some fixes in dealing with special characters.,"edit plugin: you can now edit metadata on the fly during the import process. the plugin provides two new interactive options: one to edit your music s metadata, and one to edit the matched metadata retrieved from musicbrainz . this feature is still in its early stages, so please send feedback if you find anything missing. #1846 #396",duplicates plugin: emit an error when the checksum config option is set incorrectly.,the write command avoids displaying the item name if there are no changes for it.,"refactored the move functions the beets.library module and the manipulate_files function in beets.importer to use a single parameter describing the file operation instead of multiple boolean flags. there is a new numerated type describing how to move, copy, or link files. #2682","relatedly, the beet program now accept top-level options --format-item and --format-album before any subcommand to control how items and albums are displayed. #1271","happy new year! this new version includes a cornucopia of new features from contributors, including new tags related to classical music and a new acousticbrainz submit plugin for performing acoustic analysis on your music. the random plugin has a new mode that lets you generate time-limited music for example, you might generate a random playlist that lasts the perfect length for your walk to work. we also access as many web services as possible over secure connections now https everywhere!",date-based queries that are malformed no longer crash beets and instead fail silently.,support for aiff files. tags are stored as id3 frames in one of the file s iff chunks. thanks to evan purkhiser for contributing support to mutagen.,fix a bug that caused the lastgenre plugin and other plugins not to modify files tags even when they successfully change the database.,"discogs plugin: fix a crash when a release does not contain format information, and increase robustness when other fields are missing. #2302",fix an incompatibility in bpd with libmpc .,quiet import: a new -q command line switch for the import command suppresses all prompts for input; it pessimistically skips all albums that the importer is not completely confident about.,convert plugin: avoid crashes when tags cannot be written to newly converted files.,"added support for the wavpack and musepack formats. unfortunately, due to a limitation in the mutagen library , musepack sv8 is not yet supported. here s the upstream bug in question.",lastgenre plugin: a new configuration option lets you choose to retrieve artist-level tags as genres instead of album- or track-level tags. thanks to peter fern and peter schnebel.,importing without autotagging now prints out album names as it imports them to indicate progress.,"fingerprint values are now properly stored as strings, which prevents strange repeated output when running beet write. thanks to holzhaus. #3097 #2942","fetchart plugin: determine the file extension for downloaded images based on the image s magic bytes. the plugin prints a warning if result is not consistent with the server-supplied content-type header. in previous versions, the plugin would use a .jpg extension for all images. #2053",fix a regression on windows that caused all relative paths to be not found .,fetchart plugin: the plugin no longer gets skipped during import when the edit candidates option is used from the edit plugin. #2734,the bitrate of lossless files is now calculated from their file size .,don t display changes for fields that are not in the restricted field set. this fixes write showing changes for fields that are not written to the file.,silenced some confusing error messages when searching for a non-musicbrainz id. using an invalid id at the enter id: importer prompt now just silently returns no results. more info is in the verbose logs.,a new beet move command can copy or move files into your library directory or to another specified directory.,"embedart plugin: the plugin now uses jpg as an extension rather than jpeg, to ensure consistency with the fetchart plugin. thanks to tweitzel. #2254 #2255","when importing files that are already in the library database, the items are no longer duplicated instead, the library is updated to reflect the new metadata. this way, the import command can be transparently used as a re-import.",lyrics plugin: avoid fetching truncated lyrics from the google backed by merging text blocks separated by empty <div> tags before scraping.,a new id3v23 config option makes beets write mp3 files tags using the older id3v2.3 metadata standard. use this if you want your tags to be visible to windows and some older players.,"embedart plugin: the embedart command now embeds each album s associated art by default. the --file option invokes the old behavior, in which a specific image file is used.",play plugin: the command config option can now contain arguments . thanks to alessandro ghedini.,"the importer no longer tries to highlight partial differences in numeric quantities , which was often confusing.","this release built up a longer-than-normal list of nifty new features. we now support dsf audio files and the importer can hard-link your files, for example.",the -f option to the beet list command can now contain template functions as well as field references. thanks to steve dougherty.,re-imports of your existing music now preserve its added date and flexible attributes. thanks to stig inge lea bj rnsen.,the playlist plugin can query the beets library using m3u playlists. thanks to holzhaus and xenopathic. #123 #3145,path formats can now include unescaped commas when they are not part of a function call. #2166 #2213,fixed a bug with reading invalid integers from id3 tags.,"this release focuses on a large number of small fixes and improvements that turn beets into a well-oiled, music-devouring machine. see the full release notes, below, for a plethora of new features.",fetchart plugin: the beet fetchart command can now associate local images with albums . thanks to brilnius.,plugins can now add parallel stages to the import pipeline. see writing plugins.,"the move command has a new --pretend option, making the command show how the items will be moved without actually changing anything.",add a new option to automatically upload to google play music library on track import. thanks to shuaiscott.,embyupdate plugin: the plugin can now use an api key instead of a password to authenticate with emby. #2045 #2117,thumbnails plugin: fix a crash with unicode paths. #1686,"a new importer configuration option, incremental_skip_later, lets you avoid recording skipped directories to the list of processed directories in incremental mode. this way, you can revisit them later with another import. thanks to sekjun9878. #2773","this is just a little bug fix release. with 1.4.2, we re also confident enough to recommend that anyone who s interested give python 3 a try: bugs may still lurk, but we ve deemed things safe enough for broad adoption. if you can, please install beets with pip3 instead of pip2 this time and let us know how it goes!","convert plugin: the plugin now runs before other plugin-provided import stages, which addresses an issue with generating replaygain data incompatible between the source and target file formats. thanks to autrimpo. #2814",convert plugin: embed cover art into converted files. previously they were embedded into the source files.,"a new flag -i to the import command runs incremental imports, keeping track of and skipping previously-imported directories. this has the effect of making repeated import commands pick up only newly-added directories. the import_incremental config option makes this the default.",mpdupdate plugin: domain sockets can now begin with a tilde as well as a slash. thanks to johann kl hn.,"original_date determines whether, when importing new albums, the year, month, and day fields should reflect the specific release date or the original release date. note that the original release date is always available as original_year, etc.",the write plugin event allows plugins to change the tags that are written to a media file.,"the modify now correctly converts types when modifying non-string fields. you can now safely modify the comp flag and the year field, for example. thanks to lucas duailibe.",fetchart plugin: command output is now colorized. thanks again to brilnius.,more consistent format and colorization of album and track metadata.,there are some changes for developers:,strongly prefer releases with a matching musicbrainz album id. this helps beets re-identify the same release when re-importing existing files.,note the changes to the dependencies on jellyfish and munkres.,lastgenre plugin: the force config option now defaults to true and controls the behavior of the import hook. ,filename collisions are now avoided when moving album art.,"compatibility with the latest version of mutagen, 1.23.",the new fromfilename plugin guesses tags from the filenames during import when metadata tags themselves are missing.

since version 1.4.1. #2921","python 2.6 compatibility for beatport, missing plugin, and duplicates plugin. thanks to wesley bitter and pedro silva.","the autotagging heuristics have been tweaked in situations where the musicbrainz database did not contain track lengths. previously, beets penalized matches where this was the case, leading to situations where seemingly good matches would have poor similarity. this penalty has been removed.",tracks on multi-disc albums can now be numbered per-disc instead of per-album via the per_disc_numbering config option.,"echonest plugin: echo nest similarity now weights the tempo in better proportion to other metrics. also, options were added to specify custom thresholds and output formats. thanks to adam m.",fix an error when fingerprinting

duplicates, claiming that there were empty albums in the database even when there were not. #1652",fix a crash with some files with unreadable itunes soundcheck metadata. #1666,"albums and items now have flexible attributes. this means that, when you want to store information about your music in the beets database, you re no longer constrained to the set of fields it supports out of the box .

bodill.,the web plugin encapsulates a simple web-based gui for beets. the current iteration can browse the library and play music in browsers that support html5 audio.,"the musicbrainz backend and discogs plugin now both provide a new attribute called track_alt that stores more nuanced, possibly non-numeric track index data. for example, some vinyl or tape media will report the side of the record using a letter instead of a number in that field. #1831 #2363",the performance of the autotagger s matching mechanism is vastly improved. this should be noticeable when matching against very large releases such as box sets.,added whitespace padding to missing tracks dialog to improve readability. thanks to jams2. #2962,"sorting is now case insensitive by default. this means that artists will be sorted lexicographically regardless of case. for example, the artist alt-j will now properly sort before yacht. you can turn this new behavior off using the sort_case_insensitive configuration option. see sort order. #1429",lyrics plugin: a new google custom search backend was added for finding lyrics on a wide array of sites. thanks to fabrice laporte.,"discogs plugin: compatibility with

the release id and the track list position. thanks to dbogdanov. #2336,"flexible field types mean that some functionality that has previously only worked for built-in fields, like range queries, can now work with plugin- and user-defined fields too. for starters, the echonest plugin and mpdstats plugin now mark the types of the fields they provide so you can now say, for example, beet ls liveness:0.5..1.5 for the echo nest liveness attribute. the types plugin makes it easy to specify field types in your config file.",new random plugin: randomly select albums and tracks from your library. thanks to philippe mongeau.,replaygain plugin: fix a corner-case with the bs1770gain backend where replaygain values were assigned to the wrong files. the plugin now requires version 0.4.6 or

create hard links on filesystems that support them. thanks to jacobwgillespie. #2445,"the tracktotal attribute is now a track-level field instead of an album-level one. this field stores the total number of tracks on the album, or if the per_disc_numbering config option is set, the total number of tracks on a particular medium . the field was causing problems with that per_disc_numbering mode: different discs on the same album needed different track totals. the field can now work correctly in either mode.","as usual, there are also innumerable little fixes and improvements:","as usual,

now set correctly .",item and album queries are much faster.,the database_change event now sends the item or album that is subject to a change.,"version 1.4.5 adds some oft-requested features. when you re importing files, you can now manually set fields on the new music. date queries have gotten much more powerful: you can write precise queries down to the second, and we now have relative queries like -1w, which means one week ago.",the %title template function now works correctly with apostrophes. thanks to guilhermehideki. #3033,convert plugin: a new --keep-new option lets you store transcoded files in your library while backing up the originals . thanks to lucas duailibe.

copy.deepcopy",fixed issue with gradientdescenttrainer when constructed with validation_data_loader=none and learning_rate_scheduler!=none.,"the dataloader now decides whether to load instances lazily or not. with the pytorchdataloader this is controlled with the lazy parameter, but with the multiprocessdataloading this is controlled by the max_instances_in_memory setting.",allow overrides to be json string or dict.,"allennlp.data.dataloader is now an abstract registrable class. the default implementation remains the same, but was renamed to allennlp.data.pytorchdataloader.",fixed a bug where forward hooks were not cleaned up with saliency interpreters if there was an exception.,added a command to count the number of instances we're going to be training with,"improved nn.util.move_to_device function by avoiding an unnecessary recursive check for tensors and adding a non_blocking optional argument, which is the same argument as in torch.tensor.to.","fixed a lot of instances where tensors were first created and then sent to a device with .to. instead, these tensors are now created directly on the target device.","added tasksuite base class and command line

model.get_parameters_for_histogram_logging.,"allennlp.common.util.peak_memory_mb renamed to peak_cpu_memory, and allennlp.common.util.gpu_memory_mb renamed to peak_gpu_memory, and they both now return the results in bytes as integers. also, the peak_gpu_memory function now utilizes pytorch functions to find the memory usage instead of shelling out to the nvidia-smi command. this is more efficient and also more accurate because it only takes into account the tensor allocations of the current pytorch process.","vocabulary.from_files and cached_path will issue a warning, instead of failing, when a lock on an existing resource can't be acquired because the file system is read-only.","the format is based on keep a changelog, and this project adheres to semantic versioning.","added an option to pretrainedtransformerembedder and pretrainedtransformermismatchedembedder to use a scalar mix of all hidden layers from the transformer model instead of just the last layer. to utilize this, just set last_layer_only to false.",fixed handling of http errors when fetching remote resources with cached_path. previously the content would be cached even when certain errors - like 404s - occurred. now an httperror will be raised whenever the http response is not ok.,added abstraction and concrete implementation for gridembedder,trainer can accept callbacks simply with name callbacks instead of trainer_callbacks.,fixed default masks that were erroneously created on the cpu even when a gpu is available.,replaced the nvidia apex amp module with torch's native amp module. the default trainer now takes a use_amp: bool parameter instead of the old opt_level: str parameter.,fixed a bug regarding token indexers with the interleavingdatasetreader when used with multi-process data loading.,"cpu memory for every worker is now reported in the logs and the metrics. previously this was only reporting the cpu memory of the master process, and so it was only correct in the non-distributed setting.",added a util function allennlp.nn.util.dist_reduce for handling distributed reductions. this is especially useful when implementing a distributed metric.,"fixed typo with registered name of rouge metric. previously was rogue, fixed to rouge.",tqdm output now looks much better when the output is being piped or redirected.,added the ability to use predictors with multitask models through

memory usage to tensorboard. this is mainly for debugging because using it can cause a significant slowdown in training.,added abstraction and concrete implementation for image loading,added the option to enable or disable gradient checkpointing for transformer token embedders via boolean parameter gradient_checkpointing.,"fixed how truncation was handled with pretrainedtransformertokenizer. previously, if max_length was set to none, the tokenizer would still do truncation if the transformer model had a default max length in its config. also, when max_length was set to a non-none value, several warnings would appear for certain transformer models around the use of the truncation parameter.","a multitaskmodel and abstractions to use with it, including backbone and head. the multitaskmodel first runs its inputs through the backbone, then passes the result to each head that's in use.","changed the behavior of lazy types in from_params methods. previously, if you defined a

predictor.from_path.,fixed a bug where some activation implementations could not be pickled due to involving a lambda function.,"fixed the computation of saliency maps in the interpret code when using mismatched indexing. previously, we would compute gradients from the top of the transformer, after aggregation from wordpieces to tokens, which gives results that are not very informative. now, we compute gradients with respect to the embedding layer, and aggregate wordpieces to tokens separately.",fixed a bug where hotflip would crash with a model that had multiple tokenindexers and the input

selfattentivespanextractor can also embed span widths.",changed how gradients are zeroed out with an optimization. see this video from nvidia at around the 9 minute mark.,"when cached_path is called on a local archive with extract_archive=true, the archive is now extracted into a unique subdirectory of the cache root instead of a subdirectory of the archive's directory. the extraction directory is also unique to the modification time of the archive, so if the file changes, subsequent calls to cached_path will know to re-extract the archive.",made with material for mkdocs,"fixed a bug in distributed training where the vocab would be saved from every worker, when it should have been saved by only the local master process.",fixed a bug where beamsearch would fail if max_steps was equal to 1.,"improved the band-aid solution for segmentation faults and the ""importerror: dlopen: cannot load any more object with static tls"" by adding a transformers import.",we set a value to epoch so

the _read method should always be a generator.",fixed a stall when using distributed training and gradient accumulation at the same time,fixed typo with labelfield string representation: removed trailing apostrophe.,"added the ability to ignore certain missing keys when loading a model from an archive. this is done by adding a class-level variable called authorized_missing_keys to any pytorch

Release notes - Albumentations Documentation,"albumentations now explicitly checks that all inputs to augmentations are named arguments and raise an exception otherwise. so if an augmentation receives input like aug instead of aug, albumentations will raise an exception. ","api for a.fda is changed to resemble api of a.histogrammatching. now, both transformations expect to receive a list of reference images, a function to read those image, and additional augmentation parameters. ","fixed a bug that led to an exception when a.load was called to deserialize a pipeline that contained a.totensor or a.totensorv2, but those transforms were not imported in the code before the call. ",getting started with albumentations,cropnonemptymaskifexists now also works with multiple masks that are provided by the masks argument to the transform function. previously this augmentation worked only with a single mask provided by the mask argument. pr #761.,"a.sequential transform that can apply augmentations in a sequence. this transform is not intended to be a replacement for a.compose. instead, it should be used inside a.compose the same way a.oneof or a.oneorother. for instance, you can combine a.oneof with a.sequential to create an augmentation pipeline containing multiple sequences of augmentations and apply one randomly chosen sequence to input data. ","a.totensorv2 now supports an additional argument transpose_mask . if the argument is set to true and an input mask has 3 dimensions, a.totensorv2 will transpose dimensions of a mask tensor in addition to transposing dimensions of an image tensor. ",keypoints and bboxes are checked for visibility after each transform ,fix a bug that causes an exception when albumentations received images with the number of color channels that are even but are not multiples of 4 . pr #638.,do not try to resize an image if it already has the required height and width. that eliminates the redundant call to the opencv function that requires additional copying of the input data. pr #639. replaycompose is now serializable. pr #623 by ilyaovodov,a.shiftscalerotate now has two additional optional parameters: shift_limit_x and shift_limit_y. if either of those parameters is set a.shiftscalerotate will use the set values to shift images on the respective axis. ,"a.padifneeded now accepts additional pad_width_divisor, pad_height_divisor to ensure image has width & height that is dividable by given values. ",fixed problems with grayscale images for a.histogrammatching. ,"fix a bug that causes some keypoints and bounding boxes to lie outside the visible part of the augmented image if an augmentation pipeline contained augmentations that increase the height and width of an image . that happened because albumentations checked which bounding boxes and keypoints lie outside the image only after applying all augmentations. now albumentations will check and remove keypoints and bounding boxes that lie outside the image after each augmentation. if, for some reason, you need the old behavior, pass check_each_transform=false in your keypointparams or bboxparams. issue #565 and pr #566.",added support to apply a.coarsedropout to masks via mask_fill_value. ,who's using,totensorv2 now automatically expands grayscale images with the shape to the shape . pr #604 by @ingwar.,fix a bug that prevents huesaturationvalue for working with grayscale images. pr #500.,a.fda now correctly uses coordinates of the center of an image. ,transforms ,fix a bug that causes errors with some values for label_fields in bboxparams. pr #504 by ilyaovodov,a.gaussianblur now supports the sigma parameter that sets standard deviation for gaussian kernel. .,dropped support of python 3.5 ,documentation fixes and updates.,fix bugs that prevent serialization of imagecompression and gaussnoise. pr #569,"change the imgaug dependency version from imgaug>=0.2.5,<0.2.7 to imgaug>=0.4.0"". now albumentations won t downgrade your existing imgaug installation to the old version. pr #658.",examples,new transformations,new transformations,frequently asked questions,"a.histogrammatching now usesread_rgb_image as a default read_fn. this function reads an image from the disk as an rgb numpy array. previously, the default read_fn was cv2.imread which read an image as a bgr numpy array. ",a.colorjitter transform that behaves similarly to colorjitter from torchvision . ,minor changes,minor changes,minor changes

however, any resulting importerror was lost instead of preserved for raising . this has been fixed."," #667: the rc4/arcfour family of ciphers has been broken since version 2.0; but since the

Changes â€” Werkzeug Documentation (2.1.x),"middleware from werkzeug.wsgi has moved to separate modules under werkzeug.middleware, along with the middleware moved from werkzeug.contrib. the old werkzeug.wsgi imports are deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0. ",cookie values are now also permitted to include slashes and equal signs without quoting.,unicode errors in hosts are now better caught or converted into bad request errors.,cgirootfix no longer modifies path_info for very old versions of lighttpd. lighttpdcgirootfix was renamed to cgirootfix in 0.9. both are deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0. ,optional request log highlighting with the development server is handled by click instead of termcolor. #1235,"the environ keys request_uri and raw_uri contain the raw path before it was percent-decoded. this is non-standard, but many wsgi servers add them. middleware could replace path_info with this to route based on the raw value. ",fixed a bug with parsing http digest headers. it rejected headers with missing nc and nonce params.,removed support for deprecated fix_headers.,"atom is deprecated. this did not fit in with the rest of werkzeug, and is better served by a dedicated library in the community.",werkzeug.wsgi.make_chunk_iter and werkzeug.wsgi.make_line_iter now support processing of iterators and streams.,added support for alternative encoding error handling and the new httpunicodeerror which behaves like a badrequest.,"when using an adhoc ssl cert with run_simple, the cert is shown as self-signed rather than signed by an invalid authority. ",if cookies are sent without values they are now assumed to have an empty value and the parser accepts this. previously this could have corrupted cookies that followed the value.,"the deprecated num_proxies argument to proxyfix sets x_for, x_proto, and x_host to match 0.14 behavior. this is intended to make intermediate upgrades less disruptive, but the argument will still be removed in 1.0. #1630","the response generated by unauthorized produces one www-authenticate header per value in www_authenticate, rather than joining them into a single value, to improve interoperability with browsers and other clients. #1755",the contrib modules are deprecated and will either be moved into werkzeug core or removed completely in version 1.0. some modules that already issued deprecation warnings have been removed. be sure to run or test your code with python -w default::deprecationwarning to catch any deprecated code you re using. ,the default url converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather than representing them with b''. ,"deprecate support for python 2.6 and 3.3. ci tests will not run for these versions, and support will be dropped completely in the next version. ",memcache client now no longer uses the buggy cmemcache module and supports pylibmc. gae is not tried automatically and the dedicated class is no longer necessary.,test.environbuilder and test.client take a json argument instead of manually passing data and content_type. this is serialized using the test.environbuilder.json_dumps method. ,"environbuilder was added and unifies the previous distinct create_environ, client and baserequest.from_values. they all work the same now which is less confusing.",fixed an issue with the filesystem session support s prune function and concurrent usage.,"limiter is removed. its specific use is handled by werkzeug directly, but stream limiting is better handled by the wsgi server in general.","new sans-io base classes for request and response have been extracted to contain all the behavior that is not wsgi or io dependent. these are not a public api, they are part of an ongoing refactor to let asgi frameworks use werkzeug. #2005","412 responses once again include entity headers and an error message in the body. they were originally omitted when implementing if-match , but the spec doesn t seem to disallow it.

text.",markdown and html parsing now behave correctly with leading whitespace.,"__all__ is now defined, so from telethon import * imports sane defaults . this is however discouraged and should be used only in quick scripts.","other internal changes include a somewhat more readable .to_bytes function and pre-computing the flag instead using bit shifting. the tlobject.constructor_id has been renamed to tlobject.constructor_id, and .subclass_of_id is also uppercase now.",besides this. tlobject.stringify was showing bytes as lists and rpc errors are reported by default:,archiving dialogs with dialog.archive or client.edit_folder is now possible.,"database is now upgraded if the version was lower, not different. from now on, this should help with upgrades and downgrades slightly.",working with chats and channels,files meant to be ran by the user now use shebangs and proper permissions.,"this update prepares the library for catching up with updates with the new telethon.telegram_client.telegramclient.catch_up method. this feature needs more testing, but for now it will let you catch up on some old updates that occurred while the library was offline, and brings some new features and bug fixes.",not using async with when needed is now a proper error.,some ids start with 1000 and these would be wrongly treated as channels.,"the library uses again only a single connection. less updates are be dropped now, and the performance is even better than using temporary connections.","spotted a new place where brokenauthkeyerror would be raised, and it now is raised there.","the above point means reply_message is now .get_reply_message, and fwd_from_entity is now get_fwd_sender. also forward was gone in the previous version, and you should be using fwd_from instead.","reconnection occurs at the mtprotosender level, and receiving responses follows a similar process, but now asyncio.future is used for the results which are no longer part of all tlobject, instead are part of the tlmessage which simplifies things.",pathlib.path is now supported for downloading and uploading media.,"yet again, a lot of work has been put into reworking the low level connection classes. this means asyncio.open_connection is now used correctly and the errors it can produce are handled properly. the separation between packing, encrypting and network is now abstracted away properly, so reasoning about the code is easier, making it more maintainable.","answering inline queries with a photo or document will now send the photo or document used in the resulting message by default. not sending the media was technically a bug, but some people may be relying on this old behaviour. you can use the old behaviour with include_media=false.","hopefully a very ungrateful bug has been removed. when you used to invoke some request through update handlers, it could potentially enter an infinite loop. this has been mitigated and it s now safe to invoke things again! a lot of updates were being dropped , and this has been fixed too.","dialog.delete has existed for a while, and now client.delete_dialog exists too so you can easily leave chats or delete dialogs without fetching all dialogs.","message.from_id is now a peer, not int! if you want the marked sender id , replace all uses of .from_id with .sender_id. this will mostly work, but of course in old and new versions you have to account for the fact that this sender may no longer be a user.",client.disconnect is now asynchronous again. this means you need to await it. you don t need to worry about this if you were using with client or client.run_until_disconnected. this should prevent the pending task was destroyed errors.,"besides the obvious layer change, the loop argument is now ignored. it has been deprecated since python 3.8 and will be removed in python 3.10, and also caused some annoying warning messages when using certain parts of the library. if you were relying on using a different loop from the one that was set, things may break.","if the python-socks library is installed , it will be used instead of pysocks for proxy support. this should fix some issues with proxy timeouts, because the new library natively supports asyncio.",asynchronous file descriptors are now allowed during download and upload.,"however, that doesn t mean calls are not possible with telethon. if you want to help design a python library to perform audio calls, which can then be used with telethon , please refer to @pytgcallschat and join the relevant chat to discuss and help with the implementation!","for proxy users, a pull request was merged that will use the python-socks library when available for proxy support. this library natively supports asyncio, so it should work better than the old pysocks. pysocks will still be used if the new library is not available, and both will be handled transparently by telethon so you don t need to worry about it.",client.send_voice_note is now client.send_file with is_voice=true.,.name property is now properly supported when sending and downloading files.,"the reason to bring this up is that telegram has changed things again, and with the introduction of anonymous administrators and channel comments, the sender of a message may not be a user! to accomodate for this, the field is now a peer and not int. as a reminder, it s always a good idea to use telethon s friendly methods and custom properties, which have a higher stability guarantee than accessing raw api fields.",client.get_dialogs is only called once again when an entity is not found to avoid flood waits.,"of course there was more work to be done regarding updates, and it s here! the library comes with a new events module . this are pretty much all the additions that come with this version change, but they are a nice addition. refer to to get started with events.","two new event handlers to ease creating normal bots with the library, namely events.inlinequery and events.callbackquery for handling @inlinebot queries or reacting to a button click. for this second option, there is an even better way:",this version is again compatible with python 3.x versions below 3.5 .,"on a different order of things, .connect also features a timeout. notice that the timeout= is not passed as a parameter anymore, and is instead specified when creating the telegramclient.",bug fixes and new small features ,bug fixes and new small features ,bug fixes and new small features ,support for inline mentions when sending and editing messages. they work like inline urls ) and also support the bot-api style .,request will be retried up to 5 times by default rather than failing on the first attempt.,"methods with a lot of arguments can no longer be used without specifying their argument. instead you need to use named arguments. this improves readability and not needing to learn the order of the arguments, which can also change.","internally, the .to_bytes function has been replaced with __bytes__ so now you can do bytes.",view new and changed raw api methods.,view new and changed raw api methods.,"for those who aren t able to install cryptg, the support for libssl has been added back. while interfacing libssl is not as fast, the speed when downloading and sending files should really be noticeably faster.","requests larger than 512 bytes will be compressed through gzip, and if the result is smaller, this will be uploaded instead.",the session s have been revisited thanks to the work of @tulir and they now use an abc so you can easily implement your own!,"code is now more pythonic , and other internal improvements , such as using logger instead a bare print too.","there probably are some bugs left, which haven t yet been found. however, the majority of code works and the application is already usable! not only that, but also uses the latest scheme as of now and handles way better the errors. this tag is being used to mark this release as stable enough.","new connections used to be cached and then reused. now only their sessions are saved, as temporary connections are spawned only when needed.","events.chataction now has respond, reply and delete for the message that triggered it.",reworked readme and examples at link,"underscores have been renamed from filenames. this means telethon.errors.rpc_error_list won t work, but you should have been using telethon.errors all this time instead.","inlinebuilder only worked with local files, but files from anywhere are supported.",empty except are no longer used which means sending a keyboard interrupt should now work properly.,"report_errors has been removed since it s currently not used, and flood_sleep_threshold is now part of the client.",msgsack is now sent in a container rather than its own request.,the thumb for download_media now supports both str and videosize.,error descriptions and information about methods is now loaded from a csv file instead of being part of several messy json files.,"hope the new, super simple readme.rst encourages people to use telethon and make it better with either suggestions, or pull request. pull requests are super appreciated, but showing some support by leaving a star also feels nice .","received errors are acknowledged to the server, so they don t happen over and over.","the list of known peers could end corrupted and have users with access_hash=none, resulting in struct error for it not being an integer. you shouldn t encounter this issue anymore.","this version also updates the format of sqlite sessions , so after upgrading and using an old session, the session will be updated, which means trying to use it back in older versions of the library won t work.","the release is primarily intended to test this big change, but also fixes python 3.5.2 compatibility which was broken due to a trailing comma.",.create_new_connection is gone for good. no need to deal with this manually since new connections are now handled on demand by the library itself.,"invite links will now use cache, so using them as entities is cheaper.","this is not considered a breaking change because stderr should only be used for logging purposes, not to emit information others may consume .","now you can use python s pickle module to serialize rpcerror and any other tlobject thanks to @vegeta1k95! a fix that was fairly simple, but still might be useful for many people.","timeouterror is now ignored, since the request will be retried up to 5 times by default.",get_input_* now works with vectors ,get_input_* now works with vectors ,get_input_* now works with vectors ,"this will install any version compatible with the written version . patch releases will never break your code . you can also use that syntax in pip install. your code can t know what new versions will look like, so saying it will work with all versions is a lie and will cause issues.",".reconnect behavior has been changed to also be more consistent by making the assumption that we ll only reconnect if the server has disconnected us, and is now private.","for convenience, a new object.to_json has been added which will by default format both of those problematic types into something sensible.","some bug in python 3.5.2 s asyncio causing 100% cpu load if you forgot to call client.disconnect. the method is called for you on object destruction, but you still should disconnect manually or use a with block.","the last release added support to force_file on any media, including things that were not possible before like .webp files. however, the force_document toggle commonly used for photos was applied twice , which prevented telegram for analyzing the images. long story short, sending files to the stickers bot stopped working, but that s been fixed now, and sending photos as documents include the size attribute again as long as telegram adds it.","the flow for sending a request is as follows: the telegramclient creates a mtprotosender with a connection, and the sender starts send and receive loops. sending a request means enqueueing it in the sender, which will eventually pack and encrypt it with its connectionstate instead of using the entire session instance. when the data is packed, it will be sent over the connection and ultimately over the tcpclient.","internally, the generated code now resides under a lot less files, simply for the sake of avoiding so many unnecessary files. the generated code is not meant to be read by anyone, simply to do its job.",the interactivetelegramclient is not shipped with pip anymore.,type hinting for all the generated request s and tlobjects! ides like pycharm will benefit from this.,different default limit for iter_messages and get_messages.,"server-side changes caused clicking on inline buttons to trigger a different error, which is now handled correctly.","more bug fixes include a correct parsing of certain tlobjects thanks to @stek29, and some wrong calls that would cause the library to crash thanks to @andr-04, and the readthread not re-starting if you were already authorized.","it has been a while since the last release, and a few bug fixes have been made since then. this release includes them and updates the scheme layer.","code generation was using f-strings, which are only supported on python 3.6.",invoking multiple requests at once with ordered=true was deadlocking.,"mostly bug fixes, but now there is a new parameter on client.iter_messages to support reversing the order in which messages are returned.","new formatting_entities parameter in client.send_message, and client.send_file to bypass the parse mode and manually specify the formatting entities.","rpc errors without parent requests caused a crash, and better logging.","signing in required a named code= parameter, but usage without a name was really widespread so it has been reverted.",add_mark= is now back on utils.get_input_peer and also on client.get_input_entity.,the correct amount of random bytes is now used in dh request,"the updatesthread is now a daemon, and should cause less issues.",with client:,"old usernames are evicted from cache, so getting entities by cached username should now be more reliable.",dead connections are now detected instead entering an infinite loop.,setup.py used to fail with wrongly generated code.,"error reporting is done in the background, and has a shorter timeout.","downloading media on different data centers is now up to x2 faster, since there used to be an invaliddcerror for each file part tried to be downloaded.",automatic reconnection with no retries was failing.,"changing the ip to which you connect to is as simple as client.session.server_address = 'ip', since now the server address is always queried from the session.","the tlobject s have now acquired a new .resolve method. while this should be used by the library alone , it means that you can now use peer types or even usernames where a inputpeer is required. the object now has access to the client, so that it can fetch the right type if needed, or access the session database. furthermore, you can reuse requests that need autocast , since .resolve is called when invoking. before, it was only done on object construction.","the telethon_generator/ can now convert .tl files into .json, mostly as a proof of concept, but it might be useful for other people.",duplicated updates should now be ignored.,"with the layer 103, telethon is now able to send and receive animated stickers! these use the 'application/x-tgsticker' mime-type and for now, you can access its raw data, which is a gzipped json.","unused attributes have been removed from the tlobject class too, and .sign_up returns the user that just logged in in a similar way to .sign_in now.",answering inline queries with media no works properly. you can now use the library to create inline bots and send stickers through them!,"the reason for this change is as simple as reading and writing shouldn t be related . even when you re simply ignoring updates, this way, once you send a request you will only need to read the result for the request. whatever telegram sent before has already been read and outside the buffer.",several new examples and updated documentation.,.get_input_photo is now used in the generated code.,"this version handles updates in a different thread . this means that both the low level tcpclient and the not-so-low-level mtprotosender are now multi-thread safe, so you can use them with more than a single thread without worrying!","telegramclient.get_entity is now public, and uses the @lru_cache decorator.",bug fixes and enhancements ,bug fixes and enhancements ,bug fixes and enhancements ,"you may have noticed that the patch versions between v1.7.2 to v1.7.7 have not been documented. this is because patch

improvements have been made, a lot of user complaints have been fixed, and a lot of user desires have been implemented. it s time to consider the public api as stable, and remove some of the old methods that were around until now for compatibility reasons. but there s one more surprise!","working with different data centers finally works! on a different order of things, reconnection is now performed automatically every time telegram decides to kick us off their servers, so now telethon can really run forever and ever! in theory.",".sender is the .chat when the message is sent in a

affect you as an end user, but at least it means the library will be ready by the time mtproto 1.0 is deprecated.","the threaded version of the library will no longer be maintained, primarily because it never was properly maintained anyway. if you have old code, stick with old versions of the library, such as 0.19.1.6.","for backwards-compatibility sake, the library has introduced the properties

code is easier to understand and reason about, including the code flow such as conditions, exceptions, where to reconnect, how the library should behave, and separating different retry types such as

from .connect to .invoke. there were some issues were .connect failed and the auth_key was none so this will ensure to have a valid auth_key when needed, even if brokenauthkeyerror is raised.","in the beginning, session files used to be pickle. this proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to add more fields. for this reason, they were migrated to use json instead. but this proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to save things like entities , so now it properly uses sqlite3, which has been well tested, to save the session files! calling .get_input_entity using a username no longer will need to fetch it first, so it s really 0 calls again. calling .get_entity will always fetch the most up to date version.","the layer changed, and a lot of things did too. if you are using raw api, you should be careful with this. in addition, some attributes weren t of type datetime when they should be, which has been fixed.","if you have worked with flask templates, you will love this update, since it gives you the same features but even more conveniently:","this release has no new major features. however, it contains some small changes that make using telethon a little bit easier. now those who

of this release is that telethon now has a custom database for all the entities you encounter, instead depending on @lru_cache on the .get_entity method.","a new sequential_updates parameter when

",run_sync_in_worker_thread is deprecated in favor of trio.to_thread.run_sync. ,the nursery context manager was rewritten to avoid use of @asynccontextmanager and @async_generator. this reduces extraneous frames in exception traces and addresses bugs regarding stopiteration and stopasynciteration exceptions not propagating correctly. ,"resourcebusyerror is now a deprecated alias for the new busyresourceerror, and brokenstreamerror is a deprecated alias for the new brokenresourceerror. ","trio 0.2.0 contains changes from 14 contributors, and brings major new features and bug fixes, as well as a number of deprecations and a very small number of backwards incompatible changes. we anticipate that these should be easy to adapt to, but make sure to read about them below, and if you re using trio then remember to read and subscribe to issue #1.","deprecate trio.open_cancel_scope in favor of trio.cancelscope, which more clearly reflects that creating a cancel scope is just an ordinary object construction and does not need to be immediately paired with entering it. ","trio 0.1.0 provided a set of built-in mechanisms for waiting for and tracking the result of individual tasks. we haven t yet found any cases where using this actually led to simpler code, though, and this feature is blocking useful improvements, so the following are being deprecated without replacement:",trio no longer crashes when an async function is implemented in c or cython and then passed directly to trio.run or nursery.start_soon. ,trio.open_tcp_stream has a new local_address= keyword argument that can be used on machines with multiple ip addresses to control which ip is used for the outgoing connection. ,the trio.hazmat.parkinglot class was rewritten to be simpler and faster ,introspecting and extending trio with trio.lowlevel,add support for trio.queue with capacity=0. queue s implementation is also faster now. ,"we ve slightly relaxed our definition of which trio operations act as checkpoints. a trio async function that exits by throwing an exception is no longer guaranteed to execute a checkpoint; it might or might not. the rules are unchanged for async functions that don t exit with an exception, async iterators, and async context managers. trio.testing.assert_checkpoints has been updated to reflect the new behavior: if its with block exits with an exception, no assertion is made. ","most of the public classes that trio exports like trio.lock, trio.socketstream, and so on weren t designed with subclassing in mind. and we ve noticed that some users were trying to subclass them anyway, and ending up with fragile code that we re likely to accidentally break in the future, or else be stuck unable to make changes for fear of breaking subclasses.",current_default_worker_thread_limiter is deprecated in favor of trio.to_thread.current_default_thread_limiter. ,"suppose one task is blocked trying to use a resource for example, reading from a socket and while it s doing this, another task closes the resource. previously, this produced undefined behavior. now, closing a resource causes pending operations on that resource to terminate immediately with a closedresourceerror. closedstreamerror and closedlistenererror are now aliases for closedresourceerror, and deprecated. for this to work, trio needs to know when a resource has been closed. to facilitate this, new functions have been added: trio.hazmat.notify_fd_close and trio.hazmat.notify_socket_close. if you re using trio s built-in wrappers like socketstream or trio.socket, then you don t need to worry about this, but if you re using the low-level functions like trio.hazmat.wait_readable, you should make sure to call these functions at appropriate times. ",remove blockingtrioportal: it was deprecated in 0.12.0. ,"add trio.process.stdio, which is a stapledstream of stdin and stdout if both of those are available, and none otherwise. this is intended to make it more ergonomic to speak a back-and-forth protocol with a subprocess. ","on windows, the iocp subsystem is generally the best way to implement async i/o operations but it s historically been weak at providing select-style readiness notifications, like trio.hazmat.wait_readable and wait_writable. we aren t willing to give those up, so previously trio s windows backend used a hybrid of select + iocp. this was complex, slow, and had limited scalability.","we cleaned up the distinction between the abstract channel interface and the memory channel concrete implementation. trio.abc.sendchannel and trio.abc.receivechannel have been slimmed down, trio.memorysendchannel and trio.memoryreceivechannel are now public types that can be used in type hints, and there s a new trio.abc.channel interface for future bidirectional channels. ","trio s default internal clock is now based on time.perf_counter instead of time.monotonic. this makes time-keeping more precise on windows, and has no effect on other platforms. ",control-c handling on windows now uses signal.set_wakeup_fd and should be more reliable ,"fortunately, we found a way to implement wait_* with iocp, so trio s windows backend has been completely rewritten, and now uses iocp exclusively. as a user, the only difference you should notice is that trio should now be faster on windows, and can handle many more sockets. this also simplified the code internally, which should allow for more improvements in the future.","and this would start the server running in the background in the nursery, and then give you back the random port it selected but not until it had finished initializing and was ready to accept requests!",add synchronous .close methods and context manager support for memorysendchannel and memoryreceivechannel. ,"we ve also added comprehensive support for ssl/tls encryption, including sni , starttls, renegotiation during full-duplex usage , and applying encryption to arbitrary streams, which allows for interesting applications like tls-over-tls. see: trio.open_ssl_over_tcp_stream, trio.serve_ssl_over_tcp, trio.open_ssl_over_tcp_listeners, and trio.ssl.",multierror now defines its exceptions attribute in __init__ to better support linters and code autocompletion. ,"for consistency with the new start method, the nursery spawn method is being renamed to start_soon ","if you re currently using trio.socket then you should switch to using our new high-level networking api instead. it takes care of many tiresome details, it s fully integrated with the abstract stream api, and it provides niceties like a state-of-the-art happy eyeballs implementation in open_tcp_stream and server helpers that integrate with nursery.start.",remove all the apis deprecated in 0.3.0 and 0.4.0. ,blockingtrioportal has been deprecated in favor of the new trio.from_thread. ,"fix regression introduced with cancellation changes in 0.12.0, where a trio.cancelscope which isn t cancelled could catch a propagating trio.cancelled exception if shielding were changed while the cancellation was propagating. ","threading interfaces have been reworked: run_sync_in_worker_thread is now trio.to_thread.run_sync, and instead of blockingtrioportal, use trio.from_thread.run and trio.from_thread.run_sync. what s neat about this is that these cooperate, so if you re in a thread created by to_thread.run_sync, it remembers which trio created it, and you can call trio.from_thread.* directly without having to pass around a blockingtrioportal object everywhere. ","add support for contextvars , and add trio.hazmat.runvar as a similar api for run-local variables. deprecate trio.tasklocal and trio.hazmat.runlocal in favor of these new apis. ","trio.current_instruments is deprecated. for adding or removing instrumentation at run-time, see trio.hazmat.add_instrument and trio.hazmat.remove_instrument ","the tiebreaker argument to trio.testing.wait_all_tasks_blocked has been deprecated. this is a highly obscure feature that was probably never used by anyone except trio.testing.mockclock, and mockclock doesn t need it anymore. ","new and improved apis for inter-task communication: trio.abc.sendchannel, trio.abc.receivechannel, and trio.open_memory_channel . this interface uses separate sender and receiver objects, for consistency with other communication interfaces like stream. also, the two objects can now be closed individually, making it much easier to gracefully shut down a channel. also, check out the nifty clone api to make it easy to manage shutdown in multiple-producer/multiple-consumer scenarios. also, the api has been written to allow for future channel implementations that send objects across process boundaries. also, it supports unbounded buffering if you really need it. also, help i can t stop writing also. see using channels to pass values between tasks for more details. ",removed everything that was deprecated in 0.2.0; see the 0.2.0 release notes below for details.,"trio.process on posix systems no longer accepts the error-prone combination of shell=false with a command that s a single string, or shell=true with a command that s a sequence of strings. these forms are accepted by the underlying subprocess.popen constructor but don t do what most users expect. also, added an explanation of quoting to the documentation. ","the submodules trio.ssl and trio.subprocess are now deprecated. their nontrivial contents have been moved to the main trio namespace. for the numerous constants, exceptions, and other helpers that were previously reexported from the standard ssl and subprocess modules, you should now use those modules directly. ","simplified nurseries: in trio, the rule used to be that parenting is a full time job , meaning that after a task opened a nursery and spawned some children into it, it had to immediately block in __aexit__ to supervise the new children, or else exception propagation wouldn t work. also there was some elaborate machinery to let you replace this supervision logic with your own custom supervision logic. thanks to new advances in task-rearing technology, parenting is no longer a full time job! now the supervision happens automatically in the background, and essentially the body of a async with trio.open_nursery block acts just like a task running inside the nursery. this is important: it makes it possible for libraries to abstract over nursery creation. for example, if you have a websocket library that needs to run a background task to handle websocket pings, you can now do that with async with open_websocket as ws: ..., and that can run a task in the background without your users having to worry about parenting it. and don t worry, you can still make custom supervisors; it turned out all that spiffy machinery was actually redundant and didn t provide much value. ","give up on trying to have different low-level waiting apis on unix and windows. all platforms now have trio.hazmat.wait_readable, trio.hazmat.wait_writable, and trio.hazmat.notify_closing. the old platform-specific synonyms wait_socket_*, notify_socket_closing, and notify_fd_closing have been deprecated. ","tasks spawned with nursery.start aren t treated as direct children of their nursery until they call task_status.started. this is visible through the task tree introspection attributes such as task.parent_nursery. sometimes, though, you want to know where the task is going to wind up, even if it hasn t finished initializing yet. to support this, we added a new attribute task.eventual_parent_nursery. for a task spawned with start that hasn t yet called started, this is the nursery that the task was nominally started in, where it will be running once it finishes starting up. in all other cases, it is none. ",trio.testing.wait_all_tasks_blocked now takes a tiebreaker= argument. the main use is to allow mockclock's auto-jump functionality to avoid interfering with direct use of wait_all_tasks_blocked in the same test.,trio socket methods like bind and connect no longer require pre-resolved numeric addresses; you can now pass regular hostnames and trio will implicitly resolve them for you. ,"trio.queue and trio.hazmat.unboundedqueue have been deprecated, in favor of trio.open_memory_channel. ","as was foretold in the v0.2.0 release notes, the bind method on trio sockets is now async. please update your calls or better yet switch to our shiny new high-level networking api, like serve_tcp. ",we no longer use runtime code generation to dispatch core functions like current_time. static analysis tools like mypy and pylint should now be able to recognize and analyze all of trio s top-level functions . ,remove clear method on trio.event: it was deprecated in 0.12.0. ,"new support for tests to cleanly hook hostname lookup and socket operations: see virtual networking for testing. in addition, trio.socket.sockettype is now an empty abstract base class, with the actual socket class made private. this shouldn t effect anyone, since the only thing you could directly use it for in the first place was isinstance checks, and those still work ",remove the apis deprecated in 0.5.0. ,you can now create an unbounded capacitylimiter by initializing with math.inf ,added an internal mechanism for pytest-trio s hypothesis integration to make the task scheduler reproducible and avoid flaky tests. ,"the iteration of the blocking generators produced by pathlib was performed in the trio thread. with this fix, the previous behavior is restored: the blocking generators are converted into lists in a thread dedicated to blocking io calls. ",design and internals,destructor methods are now protected against keyboardinterrupt. ,"if you want to use trio, but are stuck with some other event loop like qt or pygame, then good news: now you can have both. for details, see: using guest mode to run trio on top of other event loops. ",features,features,features,features,features,features,features,features,features,features,features,features,features,features,features,features,features,remove trio.open_cancel_scope which was deprecated in 0.11.0. ,remove the deprecated trio.ssl and trio.subprocess modules. ,"trio.from_thread.run no longer crashes the trio run if it is executed after the system nursery has been closed but before the run has finished. calls made at this time will now raise trio.runfinishederror. this fixes a regression introduced in trio 0.17.0. the window in question is only one scheduler tick long in most cases, but may be longer if async generators need to be cleaned up. ","the test suite now passes with openssl v1.1.1. unfortunately this required temporarily disabling tls v1.3 during tests; see openssl bugs #7948 and #7967. we believe tls v1.3 should work in most real use cases, but will be monitoring the situation. ","trio now uses signal.set_wakeup_fd on all platforms. this is mostly an internal refactoring with no user-visible effect, but in theory it should fix a few extremely-rare race conditions on unix that could have caused signal delivery to be delayed. ","the plumbing of trio s cancellation system has been substantially overhauled to improve performance and ease future planned improvements. notably, there is no longer any internal concept of a cancel stack , and checkpoints now take constant time regardless of the cancel scope nesting depth. ","trio.cancelled exceptions now always propagate until they reach the outermost unshielded cancelled scope, even if more cancellations occur or shielding is changed between when the cancelled is delivered and when it is caught. ","and in case you have some exotic use case where you need to spawn threads manually, but want to take advantage of trio s cache, you can do that using the new trio.lowlevel.start_thread_soon. ","if you want to create a trio.process object, you now have to call trio.open_process; calling trio.process directly was deprecated in v0.12.0 and has now been removed. ","when a trio task makes improper use of a non-trio async library, trio now causes an exception to be raised within the task at the point of the error, rather than abandoning the task and raising an error in its parent. this improves debuggability and resolves the triointernalerror that would sometimes result from the old strategy. ","when a socket sendall call was cancelled, it used to attach some metadata to the exception reporting how much data was actually sent. it no longer does this, because in common configurations like an sslstream wrapped around a socketstream it becomes ambiguous which level the partial metadata applies to, leading to confusion and bugs. there is no longer any way to tell how much data was sent after a sendall is cancelled.","there are also some classes that were explicitly designed to be subclassed, like the ones in trio.abc. subclassing these is still supported. however, for all other classes, attempts to subclass will now raise a deprecation warning, and in the future will raise an error.","entering a cancel scope whose deadline is in the past now immediately cancels it, so cancelled will be raised by the first checkpoint in the cancel scope rather than the second one. this also affects constructs like with trio.move_on_after:. ","if this causes problems for you, feel free to drop by our chat room or file a bug, to discuss alternatives or make a case for why some particular class should be designed to support subclassing. ",the hazmat function current_call_soon_thread_and_signal_safe is being replaced by trio.hazmat.triotoken,"fixed the hash behavior of trio.path to match pathlib.path. previously trio.path s hash was inherited from object instead of from pathlib.purepath. thus, hashing two trio.path's or a trio.path and a pathlib.path with the same underlying path would yield different results. ","trio is a young and ambitious project, but it also aims to become a stable, production-quality foundation for async i/o in python. therefore, our approach for now is to provide deprecation warnings where-ever possible, but on a fairly aggressive cycle as we push towards stability. if you use trio you should read and subscribe to issue #1. we d also welcome feedback on how this approach is working, whether our deprecation warnings could be more helpful, or anything else.","trio now consistently uses run for functions that take and run an async function !), and run_sync for functions that take and run a synchronous function. as part of this:",it is now possible to take weakrefs to lock and many other classes ,"it turns out that everyone got confused by the name trio.hazmat. so that name has been deprecated, and the new name is trio.lowlevel. ",use slots for memory channel state and statistics which should make memory channels slightly smaller and faster. ,trio now gives a reasonable traceback and error message in most cases when its invariants surrounding cancel scope nesting have been violated. the previous behavior was an inscrutable chain of triointernalerrors. ,"trio.catch_signals has been deprecated in favor of open_signal_receiver. the main differences are: it takes *-args now to specify the list of signals instead of catch_signals), and, the async iterator now yields individual signals, instead of batches ",a bug related to the following methods has been introduced in version 0.12.0:,"the trio.process.returncode attribute is now automatically updated as needed, instead of only when you call poll or wait. also, repr now always contains up-to-date information about the process status.

","it was decided that 0.1.0 s yield point terminology was confusing; we now use checkpoint instead. as part of this, the following functions in trio.hazmat are changing names:",upcoming breaking changes with warnings :,"remove wait_socket_*, notify_socket_closing, notify_fd_closing, run_sync_in_worker_thread and current_default_worker_thread_limiter. they were deprecated in 0.12.0. ",fix a crash that could happen when using mockclock with autojump enabled and a non-zero rate. ,"updates the formatting of exception messages raised by trio.open_tcp_stream to correctly handle a hostname passed in as bytes, by converting the hostname to a string. ","make event more lightweight by using less objects and simpler structures . this may benefit applications that create a large number of event instances, such as with the replace event object on every set idiom. ","fix a memory leak in trio.capacitylimiter, that could occur when acquire or acquire_on_behalf_of was cancelled. ","however, this is somewhat experimental, so if you use windows then please keep an eye out and let us know if you run into any problems! ",remove the deprecated tiebreaker argument to trio.testing.wait_all_tasks_blocked. ,we ve added freebsd to the list of platforms we support and test on. ,some version of macos have a buggy getaddrinfo that was causing spurious test failures; we now detect those systems and skip the relevant test when found. ,"there are a number of methods on trio.ssl.sslstream that report information about the negotiated tls connection, like selected_alpn_protocol, and thus cannot succeed until after the handshake has been performed. previously, we returned none from these methods, like the stdlib ssl module does, but this is confusing, because that can also be a valid return value. now we raise trio.ssl.needhandshakeerror instead. ",fixed some corner cases in trio socket method implicit name resolution to better match stdlib behavior. example: sock.bind) now binds to the wildcard address instead of raising an error. ,"fixed a race condition on macos, where trio s tcp listener would crash if an incoming tcp connection was closed before the listener had a chance to accept it. ","previously, when trio.run_process was cancelled, it always killed the subprocess immediately. now, on unix, it first gives the process a chance to clean up by sending sigterm, and only escalates to sigkill if the process is still running after 5 seconds. but if you prefer the old behavior, or want to adjust the timeout, then don t worry: you can now pass a custom deliver_cancel= argument to define your own process killing policy. ","on windows, trio now works around the buggy behavior of certain layered service providers that are built on top of a commercially available library called komodia redirector. this benefits users of products such as astrill vpn and qustodio parental controls. previously, trio would crash on startup when run on a system where such a product was installed. ","initial subprocess support. add trio.subprocess.process, an async wrapper around the stdlib subprocess.popen class, which permits spawning subprocesses and communicating with them over standard trio streams. trio.subprocess also reexports all the stdlib subprocess exceptions and constants for convenience. ","on ubuntu systems, the system python includes a custom unhandled-exception hook to perform crash reporting. unfortunately, trio wants to use the same hook to print nice multierror tracebacks, causing a conflict. previously, trio would detect the conflict, print a warning, and you just wouldn t get nice multierror tracebacks. now, trio has gotten clever enough to integrate its hook with ubuntu s, so the two systems should just work together.

","the low level trio.hazmat.wait_socket_readable, wait_socket_writable, and notify_socket_close now work on bare socket descriptors, instead of requiring a socket.socket object. ",calling str on a trio.cancelled exception object returns cancelled instead of an empty string. ,the event loop now holds on to references of coroutine frames for only the minimum necessary period of time. ,the resolve_local_address and resolve_remote_address methods on trio sockets have been deprecated; these are unnecessary now that you can just pass your hostnames directly to the socket methods you want to use. ,we took the opportunity to refactor run_in_trio_thread and await_in_trio_thread into the new class trio.blockingtrioportal,"the trio.path classmethods, home and cwd, are now async functions. previously, a bug in the forwarding logic meant cwd was synchronous and home didn t work at all.

","fixed several bugs in the new unix subprocess pipe support, where operations on a closed pipe could accidentally affect another unrelated pipe due to internal file-descriptor reuse, in very rare circumstances, two tasks calling send_all on the same pipe at the same time could end up with intermingled data instead of a busyresourceerror. ","trio can now be imported when sys.excepthook is a functools.partial instance, which might occur in a pytest-qt test function.

","trio.socket no longer attempts to normalize or modernize socket options across different platforms. the high-level networking api now handles that, freeing trio.socket to focus on giving you raw, unadulterated bsd sockets.","it s generally true that if you re using trio you have to use trio functions, if you re using asyncio you have to use asyncio functions, and so forth. so for example, this isn t going to work:","trio now avoids creating cyclic garbage as often. this should have a minimal impact on most programs, but can slightly reduce how often the cycle collector gc runs on cpython, which can reduce latency spikes. ","if you have a receivestream object, you can now use async for data in stream: ... instead of calling receive_some. each iteration gives an arbitrary sized chunk of bytes. and the best part is, the loop automatically exits when you reach eof, so you don t have to check for it yourself anymore. relatedly, you no longer need to pick a magic buffer size value before calling receive_some; you can await stream.receive_some with no arguments, and the stream will automatically pick a reasonable size for you. ",attempting to explicitly raise trio.cancelled will cause a runtimeerror. cancel_scope.cancel should be used instead.

**super lightweight:** small and easy to install with very few required dependencies, available on pip and conda for linux, macos and windows. simple source with a consistent api."," * allow support for (link v3.0.0, which includes some bug fixes when items are deleted from the table, and also features bloom filters."," * update versions of `cymem`, `preshed` and `murmurhash`. thinc is compiled against our memory pool and hash table libraries, `cymem` and `preshed`. changing these build-time dependencies requires thinc to be recompiled. this is one reason the major version number needed to be incremented for this release."," previous versions of thinc have relied on numpy for matrix multiplications. when numpy is installed via wheel using pip , numpy will usually be linked against a suboptimal matrix multiplication kernel. this made it difficult to ensure that thinc was well optimized for the target machine.", * add = mish`. cuda and cython kernels are included to make the activation efficient., * fix installation with cuda 9.," * add experimental support for (link to the optimizer. enable it by setting the keyword argument `lookahead_k` to a positive integer. in preliminary testing, it helps if you're not using parameter averaging, but with averaging it's a bit worse."," * add experimental support for lars to the optimizer. enable it by setting `use_lars` to `true`. in preliminary testing, this hasn't worked well at all possibly our implementation is broken.", * fix issue with creating `model` instances in child threads with operator overloading., * fix bug that caused incorrect data types to be produced by `featureextracter`.,"> this version of thinc has been rewritten from the ground up and will be used to power the upcoming (link the new thinc v8.0 is a **lightweight deep learning library** that offers an elegant, type-checked, functional-programming api for **composing models**, with support for layers defined in other frameworks such as **pytorch**, **tensorflow** or **mxnet**. you can use thinc as an interface layer, a standalone toolkit or a flexible way to develop new models. **for more details, see the (link"," - **config system:** configuration is a major pain for ml. thinc lets you describe trees of objects with references to your own functions, so you can stop passing around blobs of settings. it's simple, clean, and it works for both research and production."," thanks to dvsrepo, justindujardin, alephmelo and darkdreamingdan for the pull requests and contributions.",pipfiles and docker," * thinc v7.0 drops support for python 2.7 on windows. python 2.7 remains supported on linux and osx. support could be restored in future. we're currently unable to build our new dependency, (link for windows on python 2.7. if you can assist with this, please let us know.", * update dependencies to be able to provide binary wheels.," you can now require gpu capability using the pip ""extras"" syntax. thinc also now expects cuda to be installed at `/usr/local/cuda` by default. if you've installed it elsewhere, you can specify the location with the cuda_home environment variable. once thinc is able to find cuda, you can tell pip to install thinc with cupy, as follows:", thanks to rupsaijna and koichiyasuoka for the pull requests!," * add experimental support for (link to the optimizer. enable it with the keyword argument `use_radam` to `true`. in preliminary testing, it's a small change that's worth enabling.", * fix import errors introduced when dropping dependencies in v7.0.0., documentation and examples," thanks to giannisdaras, simonhkswan, chssch and svlandeg for the pull requests and contributions."," * fix incorrect calculation of `min_density` in `thinc.search.beam` class. previously the beam was pruned based on the raw logit scores, instead of normalized probabilities.", * improve gpu support and pytorch wrapper., * fix issue 487: require `catalogue>=2.0.3` due to performance regressions related to `importlib-metadata`, * use `collections.abc` when possible and avoid deprecation warning.," * use (link for matrix multiplication. previous versions delegated matrix multiplication to platform-specific libraries via numpy. this led to inconsistent results, especially around multi-threading. we now provide a standalone package, with the blis linear algebra routines. importantly, we've built blis to be **single-threaded**. this makes it much easier to do efficient inference, as the library will no longer spawn threads underneath you.", * dynamically include `numpy` headers and add `numpy` build constraints.," * `thinc.neural.util.get_ops` now understands device integers, e.g. `0` for gpu 0, as well as strings like `""cpu""` and `""cupy""`."," big thanks to digantamisra98 for the (link activation, especially the extensive experiments and simple gradient calculation. we expect to be using the activation in the next round of spacy models."," if you're installing thinc from a local wheel file, the syntax for adding an ""extras"" specifier is a bit unintuitive. the trick is to make the file path into a url, so you can use an `egg` clause, as follows:"," if you want to link against the intel mkl instead of openblas, the easiest way is to install miniconda. for instance, if you installed miniconda to `/opt/miniconda', the command to install thinc linked against mkl would be:"," * models now reliably distinguish predict vs. train modes, using the convention `drop=none`. previously, layers such as `batchnorm` relied on having their `predict` method called, which didn't work they were called by layers which didn't implement a `predict` method. we now set `drop=none` to make this more reliable."," * thinc now vendorizes openblas's `cblas_sgemm` function, and delegates matrix multiplications to it by default. the provided function is single-threaded, making it easy to call thinc from multiple processes. the default sgemm function can be overridden using the `thinc_blas` environment variable --- see below.", * fix murmurhash on platforms where long type was not 64 bit," - **use any framework:** switch between pytorch, tensorflow and mxnet models without changing your application, or even create mutant hybrids using zero-copy array interchange."," * fix issue explosion/spacy2995: pin `msgpack` to version `<0.6.0`, to avoid the low message-length limit introduced in v0.6.0, which breaks spacy. we will relax the pin once spacy is updated to set the `max_xx_len` argument to `msgpack.dumps`", * remove detailed `numpy` build constraints from `pyproject.toml`., * fix issue 488: fix config override & interpolate interaction," gratitude to the (link community for their crowd-sourced experiments, and especially to users lessw2020, mgrankin and others for their optimizer implementations, which we referenced heavily when implementing the optimizers for thinc. more importantly, it's super helpful to have a community filtering the deluge of papers for techniques that work on a few different datasets.

Changelog â€” Urwid 2.1.2,bargraph and progressbar can now display data more accurately by using the utf-8 vertical and horizontal eighth characters. this behavior will be enabled when the utf-8 encoding is detected and smoothed attributes are passed to the bargraph or progressbar constructors.,some new shift+arrow and numpad input sequences from rxvt and xterm are now recognized,use comparison with a string instead of is test with a literal ,use reactor.stop in twistedeventloop and document that twisted s reactor is not designed to be stopped then restarted,"replaced all tabs with 4 spaces, code is now more aerodynamic ",external event loops may now be used with the raw_display module. the new methods get_input_descriptors and get_input_nonblocking should be used instead

light gray will be used to accommodate terminals with always-black cursors.,new support for 256 and 88 color terminals with raw_display and html_fragment display modules,some unicode characters are now converted to use the g1 alternate character set with dec special and line drawing characters. these unicode characters should now just work in almost all terminals and encodings.,"new support for python 3.2 from the same 2.x code base, requires distribute instead of setuptools everything except twistedeventloop and glibeventloop is supported",new support for utf-8 encoding. unicode strings may

compositecanvas.",fix for listbox snapping to selectable widgets taller than the listbox itself,simplelistwalker now behaves as a list and supports all list operations. this class now detects when changes are made to the list and notifies the listbox object. new code should use this class to wrap lists of widgets before passing them to the listbox constructor.,"boxwidget, flowwidget and

Change history â€” Kombu 5.0.2 documentation,this change is backwards incompatible and must be enabled with the fanout_patterns transport option:,this was previously required by the simple classes and is now also required by consumer and producer.,refactor the producer consumer test cases to be based on original mocks and be passing,"tests no longer depends on distribute, which was deprecated and merged back into setuptools.","kombu can now be used with pydev, pycharm and other static analysis tools.",if the accept whitelist is set and a message is received with a content type that is not in the whitelist then a contentdisallowed exception is raised. note that this error can be handled by the already existing on_decode_error callback,"transport defaults to amqp, and is not required. user, password, port and virtual_host is also not mandatory and will default to the corresponding transports default.","consumer/producer can now be instantiated without a channel, and only later bound using .revive.","it was possible to enable this mode previously using the fanout_prefix, and fanout_patterns transport options, but now these are enabled by default.",amqp: transport options are now merged with arguments supplied to the connection.,"when using celery and the pickle serializer with binary data as part of the payload, unicodedecodeerror would be raised as the content was not utf-8. we now replace on errors.","the dead-letter queue was enabled by default to help application authors, but now that kombu is stable it should be removed. there are after all many cases where messages should just be dropped when there are no queues to buffer them, and keeping them without supporting automatic cleanup is rather considered a resource leak than a feature.","still, it is possible that using priorities in combination with routing can be more beneficial than using routing or priorities alone. experimentation and monitoring should be used to prove this.",and amqp.connectionerror and amqp.channelerror is used instead.,"auto delete has been described as a misfeature, and therefore we have disabled it.","message compatibility is handled by adding a body_encoding property, so messages sent by older versions is compatible with this release. however if you are accessing the messages directly not using kombu, then you have to respect the body_encoding property.",auto delete support for virtual transports were incomplete and could lead to problems so it was removed.,now comes with default global connection and producer pools.,removed deprecated use of stopiteration in generators and invalid regex escape sequence.,"exchange.delivery_mode now defaults to none, and the default is instead set by producer.publish.",the transport is implemented on top of azure service bus and offers paas support for more demanding celery workloads in azure. the transport is intended to be used in conjunction with the azure cosmosdb backend.,"kombu 3 consumers will no longer accept pickle/yaml or msgpack by default, and you will have to explicitly enable untrusted deserializers either globally using kombu.enable_insecure_serializers, or using the accept argument to consumer.",compression can now be used with binary message payloads.,"the accept argument was first supported for consumers in version 2.5.10, and first supported by queue.get in version 2.5.15 so to stay compatible with previous versions you can enable the previous behavior:",this fixes an issue when using gevent/eventlet and a message is handled after the consumer is canceled resulting in a message for queue without consumers error.,the transport is implemented on top of azure storage queues. this offers a simple but scalable and low-cost paas transport for celery users in azure. the transport is intended to be used in conjunction with the azure block blob storage backend.,for example the default broker is expressed as:,redis: now works with linux ,"in addition, an undeliverablewarning is now emitted when the dead-letter queue is enabled and a message ends up there.","this used to be the case before, but the behavior was accidentally changed while switching to using blocking pop.","the polling interval default has been changed to 0 and a new transport option has been added. this parameter specifies how long to wait for a message from sqs, and defaults to 20 seconds, which is the maximum value currently allowed by amazon sqs.","it was introduced as an experimental transport in kombu 3.0, but is now mature enough to be fully supported.",fixed infinite loop when entity.channel is replaced by revive on connection drop.,"the latest version drastically changed api, and it is not compatible yet.",api compatible with librabbitmq so that it can be used as a pure-python replacement in environments where rabbitmq-c cannot be compiled. librabbitmq will be updated to support all the same features as py-amqp.,"sqs: long polling is now disabled by default as it was not implemented correctly, resulting in long delays between receiving messages .","kombu now requires version 2.10.4 or greater of the redis library, in line with celery",connection.autoretry: now works with functions missing wrapped attributes,acks are now implemented by storing a copy of the message when the message is consumed. the copy is not removed until the consumer acknowledges or rejects it.,"note that the path component always starts with a forward-slash. this is necessary to distinguish between the virtual host and / , which are both acceptable virtual host names.","other callbacks specified using the callbacks argument, and the receive method will be not be called when a on message callback is present.","the connection alias has been available since version 1.1.3, and brokerconnection will still work and is not deprecated.",use sismember instead of smembers command to check if queue exists in a set. time complexity is increased from o to o where n is the set cardinality.,compression errors are now handled as decode errors and will trigger the consumer.on_decode_error callback if specified.,"pickle is known to be a security concern as it will happily load any object that is embedded in a pickle payload, and payloads can be crafted to do almost anything you want. the default serializer in kombu is json but it also supports a number of other serialization formats that it will evaluate if received: including pickle.",virtual: message.reject is now supported by virtual transports .,qpid: messages are now durable by default,or it can be a single string argument with several urls separated by semicolon:,"the pyamqp:// transport will be the default fallback transport in kombu version 3.0, when librabbitmq is not installed, and librabbitmq will also be updated to support the same features.",queues that are declared with a ttl are now also be excluded from the in-memory cache in case they expire between publishes on the same channel.,pinned pycurl to 7.43.0.2 as it is the latest build with wheels provided,"if you have previously used django-kombu, then there is no need to recreate the tables, as the old tables will be fully compatible with the new version.",this improvement will create a new compund index for queue and _id in order to be able to use both indexed fields for getting a new message and sorting by _id. it ll be necessary to manually delete the old index from the collection.,this was caused by the use of __hash__ to distinguish them.,now uses pickle protocol 2 by default to be cross-compatible with python 3.,this change is not backwards incompatible and you are encouraged to update all your system using a previous version as soon as possible.,"py-amqp is now the new default transport, replacing

Whatâ€™s New â€” xlwings dev documentation,an explicit exception is raised when range is called with 0-based indices ,"pandas dataframes and series are now supported for reading and writing, both via range object and udfs",": importing udfs with the add-in was throwing an error if the filename was including characters like spaces or dashes . to fix this, close excel completely and run xlwings addin update.", macos: the regression with book.fullname that was introduced with 0.20.1 has been fixed ., xlwings.view and xlwings.load now use chunking by default .,"upon writing, pandas series are now shown by default with their name and index name, if they exist. this can be changed using the same options as for dataframes :","new documentation about how to use xlwings with other languages like r and julia, see xlwings with r and julia.",sheet.autofit and range.autofit: the integer argument for the axis has been removed . use string arguments rows or r for autofitting rows and columns or c for autofitting columns .,"for array formulas with or without numpy, see the docs: user defined functions ",: this version adds support for the vba module on mac excel 2016 and is now feature equivalent with mac excel 2011 ., pywin32 is now automatically installed when using pip , windows: fix a regression introduced with 0.20.0 that would cause an attributeerror: range.clsid with async and legacy dynamic array udfs .,"optimized connection: set the optimized_connection = true in the vba settings. this will use a com server that will keep the connection to python alive between different calls and is therefore much more efficient. however, changes in the python code are not being picked up until the pythonw.exe process is restarted by killing it manually in the windows task manager. the suggested workflow is hence to set optimized_connection = false for development and only set it to true for production - keep in mind though that this feature is still experimental!",the atleast_2d keyword had no effect on ranges consisting of a single cell and was raising an error when used in combination with the asarray keyword. both have been fixed :,xlwings.view has been enhanced to accept an optional sheet object ,"exciting times! v0.9.0 is a complete rewrite of xlwings with loads of syntax changes . but more importantly, this release adds a ton of new features and bug fixes that would have otherwise been impossible. some of the highlights are listed below, but make sure to check out the full migration guide for the syntax changes in details. note, however, that the syntax for user defined functions did not change. at this point, the api is fairly stable and we re expecting only smaller changes on our way towards a stable v1.0 release.","xlwings can now be used with threading, see the docs: threading and multiprocessing .",": a long-standing bug that caused the excel file to close and reopen under certain circumstances has been fixed : depending on your security settings and in connection with files downloaded from the internet or possibly in connection with some add-ins, excel was either closing the file and reopening it or giving a file already open warning. this has now been fixed which means that the examples downloaded from the homepage should work right away after downloading and unzipping."," the udf server has received a serious upgrade by njwhite, getting rid of the many issues that were around with using a combination of async functions and legacy dynamic arrays. you can now also call functions defined via async def, although for the time being they are still called synchronously from excel .", # x will be returned unchanged as transposed both when reading and writing,note that you will need to update the vba module and that apart from pywin32 there is now a new dependency for the windows version: comtypes. it should be installed automatically though when installing/upgrading xlwings with pip.,"when writing to ranges while excel is busy, xlwings is now retrying until excel is idle again ","converters are accessed via the new options method when dealing with xlwings.range objects or via the @xw.arg and @xw.ret decorators when using udfs. as an introductory sample, let s look at how to read and write pandas dataframes:","this version marks an important first step on our path towards a stable release. it introduces converters, a new and powerful concept that brings a consistent experience for how excel ranges and their values are treated both when reading and writing but also across xlwings.range objects and user defined functions .",: vba settings: udf_path has been replaced with udf_modules. the default behaviour doesn t change though .,"calling python from within excel vba is now also supported on mac, i.e. python functions can be called like this: runpython""). running frozen executables isn t available yet on mac though.", native dynamic array formulas can now be used with async formulas ," the interpreter setting has been deprecated in favor of platform-specific settings: interpreter_win and interpreter_mac, respectively. this allows you to use the sheet config unchanged on both platforms .",": workbook.caller is now also accessible within functions that are decorated with @xlfunc. previously, it was only available with functions that used the @xlsub decorator .", fixed an issue when the new async_mode was used together with numpy arrays ,the syntax to add a new chart has been slightly changed :,log file has been retired and removed from the configuration/add-in.,"the purpose of this document is to enable you a smooth experience when upgrading to xlwings v0.9.0 and above by laying out the concept and syntax changes in detail. if you want to get an overview of the new features and bug fixes, have a look at the release notes. note that the syntax for user defined functions didn t change.", python 3.6 is now supported ,"excel constants have been added under their original excel name, but categorized under their enum , e.g.:","log_file: so far, the log file has been placed next to the excel file per default . this has been changed as it was causing issues for files on sharepoint/onedrive and mac excel 2016: the place where log_file = """" refers to depends on the os and the excel version.","this release adds an often requested & powerful new feature to user defined functions : dynamic expansion for array formulas. while excel offers array formulas, you need to specify their dimensions up front by selecting the result array first, then entering the formula and finally hitting ctrl-shift-enter. while this makes sense from a data integrity point of view, in practice, it often turns out to be a cumbersome limitation, especially when working with dynamic arrays such as time series data."," mac excel 2011 is now supported again with the new add-in. however, since excel 2011 doesn t support the ribbon, the config file has been created/edited manually, see environment variables .",this is a simple example that demonstrates the syntax and effect of udf expansion:," the xlwings dlls are now properly versioned, allowing to use pre 0.11 releases in parallel with >0.11 releases ",advanced features, this release fixes a bug introduced with v0.11.6 that wouldn t allow to open workbooks by name ,: matplotlib figures are now converted to 300 dpi pictures for better quality when using them with pictures.add .,": sometimes, a column was referenced instead of a named range ",unicode book names are again supported .,": user defined functions support now multiple source files, see also under api changes below. for example : udf_modules=""common;myproject""",cross-platform: xlwings is now additionally supporting microsoft excel for mac. the only functionality that is not yet available is the possibility to call the python code from within excel via vba macros.,this version adds two exciting but still experimental features from excelpython :,"expand option: this works the same as the range properties table, vertical and horizontal but is only evaluated when getting the values of a range:","xlwings.book.save now supports relative paths. also, when saving an existing book under a new name without specifying the full path, it ll be saved in python s current working directory instead of in excel s default directory .","settings don t have to be manipulated in vba code anymore, but can be either set globally via ribbon/config file or for the workbook via a special worksheet","objects like books, sheets etc. can now be compared and are properly hashable",": like windows, mac now also only shows errors in a popup. before it was including stdout, too ","if a sheet, range or chart object is instantiated without an existing workbook object, a user-friendly error message is raised .",this release brings further improvements with regards to the add-in:," runfronzenpython now accepts spaces in the path of the executable, but in turn requires to be called with command line arguments as a separate vba argument. example: runfrozenpython ""c:\path\to\frozen_executable.exe"", ""arg1 arg2"" .",: python errors are now also shown in a message box. this makes the mac version feature equivalent with the windows version :, opening a file via xw.book was causing an additional book1 to be opened in case excel was not running yet ," fixed an issue introduced with the previous release that always showed the command prompt when running udfs, not just when using conda envs .","the excelpython project has been fully merged into xlwings. this means that on windows, udf s are now supported via decorator syntax. a simple example:","you can still use a vba module instead of the add-in, but the recommended way is the add-in","pro breaking change: the table.update method has been changed to treat the dataframe s index consistently whether or not it s being written to an excel table: by default, the index is now transferred to excel in both cases.",the most important update with this release was made on windows: the methodology used to make a connection to workbooks has been completely replaced. this finally allows xlwings to reliably connect to multiple instances of excel even if the workbooks are opened from untrusted locations . this gets rid of the dreaded filename is already open... error message that was sometimes shown in this context. it also allows the vba hooks to work correctly if the very same file is opened in various instances of excel.,application as attribute of a workbook has been removed :," windows: with udfs, you can now get easy access to the caller by using caller as a function argument . in that sense, caller is now a reserved argument by xlwings and if you have any existing arguments with this name, you ll need to rename them:", runpython can now be called in parallel from different excel instances .,this release adds new features to user defined functions :,>>> sheet.add # include name and position," added support for the characters object via range or shape objects, see characters.",: excel on windows now handles unicode file paths correctly with untrusted documents. .,it also supports indexing and slicing of range objects:,conda base has been renamed into conda path to reduce the confusion with the conda env called base. please adjust your settings accordingly! ,added support to manipulate named ranges :,installation is now putting all files in the correct place .,"to reference the calling workbook when running code from vba, you now have to use workbook.caller. this means that wb = workbook is now consistently creating a new workbook, whether the code is called interactively or from vba.","the vba error pop-up can now be muted by setting show_log = false in the vba settings. to be used with care, but it can be useful on mac, as the pop-up window is currently showing printed log messages even if no error occurred.",new docs about matplotlib & plotly charts and custom converter,this release adds support for asynchronous functions . making a function asynchronous is as easy as:,new class application with quit method and properties screen_updating und calculation . it can be conveniently accessed from within a workbook . a few examples:," windows: when running app.quit, the application is now properly closed without leaving a zombie process behind .",note that support for python 2.6 has been dropped,support for pandas series has been added :," xlwings addin install is now available on macos. on windows, it has been fixed so it should now work reliably .","xlwings works now also with numpy < 1.7.0. before, doing something like range.value = 'foo' was causing a notimplementederror: not implemented for this type error when numpy < 1.7.0 was installed .", windows: the setting show console now also shows/hides the command prompt properly when using the udf server with conda. there is no more switching between python and pythonw required .,"the workbook class has the following additional methods: current and set_current. they determine the default workbook for sheet, range or chart. on windows, in case there are various excel instances, when creating new or opening existing workbooks, they are being created in the same instance as the current workbook.",xlwings with r and julia," added support for the chunksize option: when you read and write from or to big ranges, you may have to chunk them or you will hit a timeout or a memory error. the ideal chunksize will depend on your system and size of the array, so you will have to try out a few different chunksizes to find one that works well :",: excel 2011 for mac now supports unicode characters in the filename when called via vba s runpython .,threading and multiprocessing,pro running runpython with embedded code was broken in 0.22.0 .,vba settings: python_win and python_mac must now include the interpreter if you are not using the default . e.g.:,": when using udfs, you can now use 'range' for the convert argument where you would use

pex/CHANGES.rst at main Â· pantsbuild/pex Â· GitHub,"pex 2.0.0 is cut on the advent of a large, mostly internal change for typical use cases: it now uses vendored pip to perform resolves and wheel builds. this fixes a large number of compatibility and correctness bugs as well as gaining feature support from pip including handling manylinux2010 and manylinux2014 as well as vcs requirements and support for pep-517 & pep-518 builds.",this release adds support for including sources and resources directly in a produced pex - without the need to use pants.,"with network configuration now wired up, the pex_http_retries and pex_http_timeout env var support in pex 1 that was never wired into pex 2 is now dropped in favor of passing --retries and --timeout via the cli ","bug fix: we did not normalize package names in resolvableset, so it was possible to depend on sphinx and sphinx-1.4a0.tar.gz and get two versions build and included into the pex. #147.","this release restores and improves support for building and running multiplatform pexes. foreign linux* platform builds now include manylinux2014 compatible wheels by default and foreign cpython pexes now resolve abi3 wheels correctly. in addition, error messages at both buildtime and runtime related to resolution of dependencies are more informative.",this release focuses on the resolver api and resolution performance. pex 2 resolving using pip is now at least at performance parity with pex 1 in all studied cases and most often is 5% to 10% faster.,the resolver api removed precedence which is now pip default precedence: wheels when available and not ruled out via the --no-wheel cli option or use_wheel=false api argument.,this release brings official support for python 3.9 and adds a new --tmpdir option to explicitly control the tmpdir used by pex and its subprocesses. the latter is useful when building pexes in space-constrained environments in the face of large distributions.,now supports extras for static urls and installable directories. #65.,"the --cache-dir setting is deprecated in favor of build time control of the cache location with --pex-root and new support for control of the cache's runtime location with --runtime-pex-root is added. as in the past, the pex_root environment variable can still be used to control the cache's runtime location.",add recipe to use pex with requests module and proxies. pr #659,the focus of this release is better support of the --platform cli arg. platforms are now better documented and can optionally be resolved to local interpreters when possible via --resolve-local-platforms to better support creation of multiplatform pexes.,the resolver api replaced fetchers with a list of indexes and a list of find_links repos.,bug fix: scrub sys.path and sys.modules based upon both supplied path and realpath of files and directories. newer versions of virtualenv on linux symlink site-packages which caused those packages to not be removed from sys.path correctly. issue #21,a new suite of pex tools is now available in pex itself and any pexes built with the new --include-tools option. use pex_tools=1 pex --help to find out more about the available tools and their usage.,"this release fixes a regression in handling explicitly requested --index or --find-links http repos. in addition, performance of the pex 2.x resolver is brought in line with the 1.x resolver in all cases and improved in most cases.",this release brings enhanced performance when using the pex cli or api to resolve requirements and improved performance for many pexed applications when specifying the --unzip option. pexes built with --unzip will first unzip themselves into the pex cache if not unzipped there already and then re-execute themselves from there. this can improve startup latency. pex itself now uses this mode in our (link,adds support for pex_path environment variable which allows merging of pex environments at runtime. this can be used to inject plugins or entry_points or modules from one pex into another without explicitly building them together. #30.,bug fix: pex-info values were overridden by environment variables with default values that were not explicitly set in the environment. fixes #135.,adds helper method to dump a package subdirectory onto disk from within a zipped pex file. this can be useful for applications that know they're running within a pex and would prefer some static assets dumped to disk instead of running as an unzipped pex file. #12.,this release upgrades pip to 20.3.3 + a patch to fix pex resolves using the pip-legacy-resolver and --constraints. the pex package is also fixed to install for python 3.9.1+.,this release changes pex requirement resolution behavior. only stable requirements are resolved by default now. the previous behavior that included pre-releases can be retained by passing --pre on the pex command line or passing allow_prereleases=true via the api.,a hotfix that finishes work started in 2.1.37 by #1304 to align pip based resolve results with --pex-repository based resolve results for requirements with '.' in their names as allowed by pep-503.,"this release includes full manylinux support, improvements to wheel resolution and a handful of other improvements and bugfixes. enjoy!",add support for parsing extras and specifiers. pr #1161,breaking change: pex -r now takes requirements.txt filenames and not requirement specs. requirement specs are now passed as arguments to the pex tool. use -- to escape command line arguments passed to interpreters spawned by pex. implements #5.,this is a hotfix release for a regression in setuptools compatibility introduced by #542.,"this release brings support for a --venv execution mode to complement --unzip and standard unadorned pex zip file execution modes. the --venv execution mode will first install the pex file into a virtual environment under ${pex_root}/venvs and then re-execute itself from there. this mode of execution allows you to ship your pexed application as a single zipfile that automatically installs itself in a venv and runs from there to eliminate all pex startup overhead on subsequent runs and work like a ""normal"" application.",this release fixes the hermeticity of pip resolver executions when the resolver is called via the pex api in an environment with pythonpath set.,the release also fixes --cert and --client-cert so that they work with pep-518 builds in addition to fixing bytecode compilation races in highly parallel environments.,change the interpretation of -i to match pip's -i. this is useful for compatibility with devpi.,this is a hotfix release that fixes a bug exposed when pex was asked to use an interpreter with a non-canonical path as well as fixes for 'current' platform handling in the resolver api.,"we now support reproducible builds when creating a pex via pex -o foo.pex, meaning that if you were to run the command again with the same inputs, the two generated pexes would be byte-for-byte identical. to enable reproducible builds when building a pex, use the flags --no-use-system-time --no-compile, which will use a deterministic timestamp and not include .pyc files in the pex.",this release adds the --intransitive option to support pre-resolved requirements lists and allows for python binaries built under gentoo naming conventions.,spruce up pex and pex-tools clis with uniform -v / --version support and default value display in help. pr #1301,"as part of the resolution performance work, pip networking configuration is now exposed via pex cli options and the networkconfiguration api type / new resolver.resolve api parameter.","bug fix: accommodate osx python python binaries. previously the osx python distributions shipped with osx, xcode and available via link could fail to be detected using the pythoninterpreter class. fixes #144.",this release fixes a performance regression in which pip would re-tokenize --find-links pages unnecessarily. the parsed pages are now cached in a pip patch that has also been submitted upstream.,"we recently regained access to the docsite, and link is now up-to-date.",this release adds support for -c and -m pexfile runtime options that emulate the behavior of the same arguments to python as well a fix for handling the non-standard platform reported by setuptools for apple system interpreters in addition to several other bug fixes.,this release fixes a bug in sys.path scrubbing / hermeticity and a bug in the -d / --sources-directory and -r / --resources-directory options whereby pep-420 implicit packages were not respected .,special thanks to dan blanchard for seeding the initial pr for manylinux support and wheel resolution improvements.,"this release changes the behavior of the --interpreter-constraint option. previously, interpreter constraints were anded, which made it impossible to express constraints like '>=2.7,<3' or '>=3.6,<4'; ie: either python 2.7 or else any python 3 release at or above 3.6. now interpreter constraints are ored, which is likely a breaking change if you have scripts that pass multiple interpreter constraints. to transition, use the native , and operator in your constraint expression, as used in the example above.",adds interpreter detection for jython and pypy.,"adds twitter.common.python.resolver resolve method that handles transitive dependency resolution better. this means that if the requirement futures==2.1.2 and an unqualified futures>=2 is pulled in transitively, our resolver will correctly resolve futures 2.1.2 instead of reporting a versionconflict if any version newer than 2.1.2 is available. rb #129","the 1.0.0 release of pex introduces a few breaking changes: pex -r now takes requirements.txt files instead of requirement specs, pex -s has now been removed since source specs are accepted as arguments, and pex -p has been removed in favor of its alias pex -o.",adds console script support via -c/--script/--console-script and pex_script. this allows you to reference the named entry point instead of the exact module:name pair. also supports scripts defined in the scripts section of setup.py. #59.,"new feature: adds an interpreter cache to the pex tool. if the user does not explicitly disable the wheel feature and attempts to build a pex with wheels but does not have the wheel package installed, pex will download it in order to make the feature work. implements #47 in order to fix #48",this is a hotfix release for 1.4.8 that fixes a regression in interpreter setup that could lead to resolved distributions failing to build or install.,"this release significantly improves performance and correctness of interpreter discovery, particularly when pyenv is involved. it also provides a workaround for eperm issues when hard linking across devices, by falling back to copying. resolve error checking also now accounts for environment markers.",use pip for resolving and building distributions. pr #788,"change the setuptools range to >=2.2,<16 by handling entrypoint changes as well as being flexible on whether pkg_resources is a package or a module. fixes #55 and #34.",bug fix: filename should be part of the .pex cache key or else multiple identical versions will incorrectly resolve ,this release fixes bugs in --unzip and --venv mode pex file execution and upgrades to the last release of pip to support python 2.7.,"this release upgrades pex to the latest pip which includes support for the new 2020-resolver (see: link as well as support for macos bigsur. although this release defaults to the legacy resolver behavior, the next release will deprecate the legacy resolver and support for the legacy resolver will later be removed to allow continuing pip upgrades going forward. to switch to the new resolver, use: --resolver-version pip-2020-resolver.",bug fix: urllibcontext used replace as a keyword argument for bytes.decode but this only works on python 3. pull request #46,"this ordinarily should not be a problem but the zipimporter caches metadata by filename instead of stat/sha, so if the underlying contents changed a runtime error would be thrown due to seemingly corrupt zip file offsets. rb #684","this release includes an initial body of work towards windows support, abi tag support for cpython 2.x and a fix for version number normalization.",add readme and supported python versions to pypi description. #258,"this release brings a fix to handle top-level requirements with environment markers, fully completing environment marker support.",this is a hotfix release that fixes requirement parsing when there is a local file in the cwd with the same name as the project name of a remote requirement to be resolved.,"this release brings a consistency fix to requirement resolution and an isolation fix that scrubs all non-stdlib pythonpath entries by default, only pre-pending or appending them to the sys.path if the corresponding --inherit-path= is used.",add interpreter constraints option and use constraints to search for compatible interpreters at exec time #427,this is a bugfix release for a regression that inadvertently went out in 1.3.0.,the resolver api removed context which is now automatically handled.,fixes an issue where sourcetranslator would overwrite .egg/.whl distributions already on disk. instead it should always check to see if a copy already exists and reuse if there.,this is a hotfix release for the bug detailed in #756 that was introduced by #752 in python 3.7 interpreters.,adds -m and --entry-point alias to the existing -e option for entry points in the pex tool to evoke the similarity to python -m.,"add delayed pkg_resources import fix from #713, with an integration test pr #730",slightly demystify the relationship between platforms and interpreters in the library api and cli pr #1047,"refactor http handling in pex to allow for alternate http implementations. adds support for requests, improving both performance and security. for more information, read the commit notes at 91c7f32. rb #778","the release also removes --use-first-matching-interpreter, which was a misfeature. if you want to use fewer interpreters when building a pex, use more precise values for --interpreter-constraint and/or --python-path, or use --python or --platform.",add type hints to util.py and tracer.py pr #1044,"for users of the pex api, it is recommended to add minor version ranges, e.g. pex>=1.0,<1.1. for users of the pex cli, major version ranges such as pex>=1,<2 should be sufficient.","adds a number of flag aliases to be more compatible with pip command lines: --no-index, -f, --find-links, --index-url, --no-use-wheel. removes -p in favor of -o exclusively.",this release brings a fix for building sdists with certain macos interpreters when creating a pex file that would then fail to resolve on pex startup.,"unlike in the past, the (link we release can now also be controlled via the pex_root environment variable. consult the cli help for --no-strip-pex-env to find out more.","beyond bugfixes for a few important edge cases, this release includes new support for @argfiles on the command line from @jjhelmus. these can be useful to overcome command line length limitations. see: link",add manylinux wheel support and fix a few bugs along the way #316,bug fix: executed entry points shouldn't be forced to run in an environment with __future__ imports enabled. ,"without this change, once a distribution aged past the ttl it would never be used again, and builds would re-create the same distributions in tmpdirs over and over again.",pex 2.1.0 should be considered the first pex 2-series release that fully replaces

pex and twitter.common.python.,this is another hotfix release to fix incorrect resolve post-processing failing otherwise correct resolves.,update cache dir when bdist_pex.run is called directly. #278 fixes #274,"there is also support for a new resolution mode when building pex files that allows you to use the results of a previous resolve by specifying it as a -pex-repository to resolve from. if you have many applications sharing a requirements.txt / constraints.txt, this can drastically speed up resolves.",bug fix: sys.exit called without arguments would cause none to be printed on stderr since pex 1.0.1. #143.,adds __hash__ to link so that packages are hashed correctly in twitter.common.python.resolver resolve,"this release adds the --use-first-matching-interpreter flag, which can speed up performance when building a pex at the expense of being compatible with fewer interpreters at runtime.","api change: decouple translation from package iteration. this removes the obtainer construct entirely, which likely means if you're using pex as a library, you will need to change your code if you were doing anything nontrivial. this adds a couple new options to resolve but simplifies the story around how to cache packages. rb #785",this release opens up setuptools support for more modern versions that support breaking changes in setup used in the wild.,this release adds

support for controlling prerelease resolution. #350 fixes #28,"bug fix: since 69649c1 we have been unpatching the side-effects of sys.modules after pex.execute. this takes all modules imported during the pex lifecycle and sets all their attributes to none. unfortunately, sys.excepthook, atexit and __del__ may still try to operate using these tainted modules, causing exceptions on interpreter teardown. this reverts just the sys unpatching so that the abovementioned teardown hooks behave more predictably. fixes #141.","this can greatly speed up repeatedly creating a pex when no requirements have changed. a build tool can create a ""requirements pex"" that contains just a static set of requirements, and build a final pex on top of that, without having to re-run pip to resolve

PyLaTeX/changelog.rst at master Â· JelteF/PyLaTeX Â· GitHub,the add add_multicolumn and add_multirow methods on tabular classes are removed in favor of the much more robust and easier to use .multirow and .multicolumn classes.,the non keyword argument for filename is now called path instead of filename to show it can also be used with paths.,"the internal method propegate_packages has been spelled correctly and made ""internal"" by adding an underscore in front of the name, resulting in _propagate_packages",default configuration for certain options can be overwritten with the new pylatex.config module.,added .pagestyle class to support the creation of various page styles. in addition to this class .head and .foot were added for creating unique headers and footers within the page styles. a .simple_page_number function was also added for easy displaying of a simple page number.,the temp directory is only removed in generate_pdf when cleaning is enabled,the container_name attribute has been changed to ~.latexobject.latex_name so it can be used more than containers. by default it is still the lowercase version of the classname. to change the default for a class you should set _latex_name,"this realease brings some great changes. the whole package has been refactored and actual documentation has been added. because of this, things have been moved an renamed. one of the most notable changes is that all normal text is now escaped by default.",compiling is more secure now and it doesn't show output unless an error occurs or explicitly specified.,use known working versions for python 3.5 and lower of ordered-set dependency,"the old table class is renamed to .tabular. a new .table class has been created that represents the table latex environment, which can be used to create a floating table.","see these docs for changes that have not yet been released and are only present in the development version. this version might not be stable, but to install it use:","the default of the filepath argument for the .document.generate_pdf and .document.generate_tex have been changed to none. the response to the default is not changed, so this is a fairly invisible change.","added tikz basic drawing functions for nodes and paths, with minimal coordinate support.","when subclassing a class and special latex packages are needed, you now have to specify the packages class attribute instead of passing packages along with the __init__ method.",added a new type of container .containercommand for supporting commands with data.,installs from git now get installed as a special version based on the commit. this is done by using versioneer.,content of subclasses of .container is now automatically escaped. content of .arguments or .options is not escaped by default.,filenames with a ~ in them now also work as figure paths. this caused issues when using temp directories on windows.,.quantity got a new options keyword argument and learned to handle uncertain quantities.,removed useless list class constructor arguments for list_spec and pos. these were probably copied from the .tabular class.,".tabular.add_row now accepts cells as arguments, so they don't have to be wrapped in a list or tuple anymore.",tables like .tabular now raise an exception when rows with wrong size are added,releases can be done with much less manual work for the maintainer in the future.,"the default allignment of a multicolumn is not c instead of |c|, since vertical lines in tables are ugly most of the time.",fix a bug in plt and one in fix_filename that caused an error when using them with some filenames ,removed base keyword argument of the .package class. .command should be used when changing of the base is needed.,fixed the testall.sh script such that sphinx and nosetests get called with the correct python version.,"add .commandbase, which can be easily subclassed for a command that is used more than once.","for all of the previous changes the old submodules and names should still work during the transition period, but they will be removed before the final release.",filenames should now be specified to the ~.document.generate_pdf/~.document.generate_tex methods of document. if this is not done the default_filename attribute will be used.,with statement support,allow the data keyword argument of containers to be a single item instead of a list. if this is the case it will be wrapped in a list on initialization.,"removed the submodules pylatex.parameters, pylatex.command and pylatex.numpy. the content of the first two was moved to pylatex.base_classes.command and the content of the last one was moved to pylatex.math.",add label and cross reference support.,command and parameter classes,the plt class has been merged with the .figure class. its ~.figure.add_plot method also doesn't take a plt argument anymore. the plt module is now imported when the ~.figure.add_plot method is used. this also allows for adding plots in the .subfigure class.,"add .noescape string class, which can be used to make sure a raw latex string is not escaped.",the table object is going to be deprecated in favor of the better named .tabular object. this will take a couple of releases.,"removed the title, author, date and maketitle arguments from the .document constructor. they were from a time when it was not possible to change the preamble, which is now very easy. they are not so commonly used that they should be part of the main .document object.",for better readability let ~.escape_latex change a newline to \\%\n instead of simply \\.,.tabular.add_row now accepts a list of mappers,allow supplying a mapper function to dumps_list and the add_row method for tabular like objects.,.quantity now correctly splits prefix and unit into seperate commands.,removed,fix bug where the geometry options were not applied in some cases,escape generated \n characters by pylatex by placing a % sign in

.document class. this way you can safely subclass it.,replace filename by filepath in the names of the arguments.,"added a new .position package with the following classes: .center , .flushleft , .flushright , .minipage , .textblock , .verticalspace and .horizontalspace ","add support for booktabs tables, which look nicer than normal tables.",/,"pypi installs will not fail anymore for python 2.7, when 3to2 and future were installed.",.document packages now get propagated from the preamble elements as well.,".container now has a ~.container.dumps_content method, which dumps it content instead of a dumps method. this allows to override just that method when subclassing .environment so you can do dump in some special inside the environment, while still keeping the \begin and \end stuff provided by .environment.",made lots of keyword arguments keyword only arguments. this was needed to make it easy to keep the api the same in the future.,all notable changes to this project will be documented on this page. this project adheres to semantic versioning.,fixes filename generation with dots in the final filename on windows.,"matplotlib support now uses the tmpfile module, this fixes permission issues with the badly previously badly located tmp directory.",add fragment class which is a container without any latex code surrounding its content.,an unfinished quantity class that can be used in conjunction with the quantitities package. link,the graphics submodule has been renamed to figure.,added,added,added,added,added,added,added,added,added,added,added,added,added,allow overriding of the default numbering of .section class.,the command and parameters submodules have been

Releases Â· patrikhuber/eos Â· GitHub,"this release updates the renderer and texture extraction, with full support for perspective projection , and contains various other smaller improvements and fixes.",updated v2::softwarerenderer and related code to compile with the latest eos changes and without opencv,the api and functionality of eos have been quite stable for a while now and proven themselves robust and useful. this release mainly constitutes the exciting bump to v1.0!,"removed render_affine, this was used in the old texture extraction and is no longer needed .",this is a release with quite a few nice changes and improvements. please read through the release notes carefully.,"added python bindings for eos::core::rect and eos::core::landmark<eigen::vector2f>. the python bindings are now using landmark and landmarkcollection natively, without having to keep a separate list of landmark identifiers.","note: whereas previously, meshes without vertex colour would be rendered with the colour , in the new renderer, they will have default colour black . in any case, it does not make sense to try and render a mesh without vertex colours or texture.","other recent changes & improvements include supporting uv coordinates with seams, support for landmark/vertex definitions in the morphablemodel class to give certain vertices a fixed semantic meaning, and lots of other things. see the release notes from v0.17.0 and v0.18.0 for more details.","removed the old render function, moved v2::softwarerenderer to the render namespace, and added a convenience function for the new renderer that can be called like the old renderer - calling code needs slight adjustments. the core of the new renderer is the same, but the architecture has been changed to mirror more closely the hardware pipeline, with vertex- and fragment shaders. results should be exactly the same, and they have the same parameters.","moved v2::extract_texture to the eos::render namespace and made it the new default . calling code needs to be adjusted slightly, but the function's parameters are very similar. this new texture extraction uses the rasterizer of the new renderer, and supports both orthographic and perspective projection.",it also contains a number of other minor improvements and an updated documentation.,"write_obj now also inverts the y axis of the uv coords, to be consistent with write_textured_obj ","this release was in the devel branch for a few months, and never actually left the devel branch. the morphablemodel format version was increased to 3, from adding landmark_definitions. since there are quite a few model files with this version in circulation, it was deemed best to make it an ""official"" model version and release it as v0.17.0.","eos/@patrikhuber is now part of github sponsors. if you are finding eos valuable, there is now the possibility of becoming a sponsor.","this might actually have been causing wrong code to be run or some bad memory access to - the assert that checks for that in sample_to_mesh is not triggered in release and relwithdebinfo builds, therefore we haven't caught this for a while.",added clear_buffers function to softwarerenderer and rasterizer to clear the colour- and depth buffers ,added functions to compute face and vertex normals of a mesh ,"moved write_obj and write_textured_obj into a separate header, eos/core/write_obj.hpp, so that including mesh.hpp doesn't result in transitively including <fstream> and <string> ","removed estimate_affine_camera. see the commit message, for people that were still using this. ","this release mainly fixes the write_obj and write_textured_obj functions to now also write out the texture triangle indices , when they're present in a mesh. previously for meshes who used a different set of texture triangle indices, this could cause weird artefacts on the top of the head because the tti were not written to the obj. ",improved softwarerenderer::render to correctly deal with texture maps with seams ,"added vertex visibility check function that supports both orthographic and perspective projection . introduced an enum class projectiontype, which specifies whether orthographic or perspective projection should be used.",these are in-progress changes on new rendering/texture extraction stuff in the render::v2 namespace - these work in principle but are not too thoroughly tested or used in eos yet.,"this release adds support for texture maps with seams. when a texture map contains seams, the vertices at the seams are usually duplicated, and then some of the triangle indices are different in uv space from the triangulation of the 3d vertices. this change allows to support the texture coordinates of the full-head 4d face model .","this is a minor update that slightly improves the internals of loading .scm models from cvssp from the university of surrey, and also adds load_scm_model to the python bindings, so these models can be loaded directly in python.","texture_triangle_indices is now correctly passed along to sample_to_mesh in all morphablemodel member functions . previously, get_mean and the draw_sample functions would have returned a mesh without the texture triangle indices .",updated extract_texture to support uv coordinates with seams ,"removed the opencv dependency of eos/morphablemodel/io/cvssp.hpp, and clarified the documentation slightly ",the updated release is also available on pypi.,the morphablemodel file format version was increased to 4 to store an additional member containing the uv triangulation ,"small maintenance release with updated python bindings, fixed demo.py script , and fixed bfm2009/2017 converter scripts."," the update also includes the most recent version of pybind11, and addition of sample_to_mesh to the python bindings.","and as always, various small improvements to the code style and to the documentation.",uncommented v2::extract_texture and updated all affected code ,"models can now optionally store landmark/vertex definitions, for example mappings like ""eye.right.outer_corner"" <=> 177 from a generic name to vertex ids - and then a second mappings file can be used, that maps from 2d landmark identifiers to these generic names . this separates the vertex definition from a particular set of 2d landmarks.","removed the old extract_texture function, which only supported affine cameras ","this release contains an important fix for models that have separate texture_triangle_indices, like e.g. the 4dfm.",improved v2::extract_texture to not crash when the projected model is partially outside the image ,"subsequently, the utils can now be built without opencv ",improved v2::extract_texture to support texture coordinates with seams ,the documentation at link is now updated to eos v1.1.0,see the v1.2.0 release notes for all the changes and improvements in this release!,added new draw_wireframe function that doesn't need opencv and added python binding for it ,/,prefixed all header guards with eos_ in the eos::core namespace to reduce possible name collisions ,the updated release is available on pypi.,revamped the image class to a better and more future-proof design ,"improved read_obj a bit to handle a few more cases. still, don't rely on it to parse every .obj file, it's not meant to do that. use your own or assimp or something like that.",please also have a look at the changes in v0.17.0.,added project function to pcamodel ,"renamed ""isomap"" to ""texturemap"" throughout, and the <filename>.isomap.png output of the example apps to <filename>.texture.png ",created new directory eos/core/image/ and moved image_opencv_interop.hpp there ,moved render::rect to core namespace,about,"now we always handle models correctly that contain texture triangle indices, like the 4dfm.","note: the storage order is now row-major, as opposed to col-major before. in the future, we may add means to choose the storage order.",updated mpark::variant to their latest master . this should fix a few compile errors with certain compilers when compiling eos in c++14 mode.,added simple image resize function ,"updated pybind11 to their latest master commit, and changed the visual studio cmake generator for the python bindings from vs 2017 to vs 2019 .",improve error messaging when loading morphablemodels with odd versions ,this is a follow-up update pushing the python bindings to pypi:,added missing inline to draw_sample ,"one major recent addition is support for the 4d face model, 4dfm, a full-head 3d morphable face model with 36 expressions/action units, from 4dface.io.",fixed constructing a 4x4 rotation matrix r instead of 3x3 in the python bindings of scaledorthoprojectionparameters
